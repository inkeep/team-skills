# <Skill Title>

## Overview
<1–3 sentences. What this skill enables.>
<Assume a first-time reader unless specified otherwise.>

## Workflow
1. <Step 1>
2. <Step 2>
3. <Step 3>

## Quality bar
Must have:
- [ ] Skill is usable with no prior context (standalone).
- [ ] Clear workflow and explicit success criteria.

Should have:
- [ ] Avoid unnecessary repetition; each section adds new information.
- [ ] Reuse the user's terminology where it improves clarity and preserves intent.
- [ ] If inputs are messy/unstructured artifacts, include a relevance-triage step.

## Examples
### Good
<short example>

### Avoid
<short counterexample>

## Validation (if needed)
1. Run: `<command>`
2. If it fails, fix and rerun
3. Stop only when it passes
