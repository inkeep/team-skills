# Write Skill

This skill helps you author **high-signal, maintainable Skills** that reliably improve agent performance without bloating context.

It is intentionally **procedural where the platform has hard constraints** (frontmatter validity, invocation controls, safety) and **guiding where multiple viable design strategies exist** (structure, tone, degree of strictness).

A skill you write should be usable by a different agent (or a human) with **no prior context**—it should stand on its own.

---

## Workflow overview

Follow the detailed steps below. In practice, the shortest correct path is:

1. **Step 0:** Identify request type (Create / Refactor / Harden / Integrate / Update).
2. **Step 2:** Capture intent + define "done."
3. **Steps 3–5:** Choose invocation/safety, execution model, and structure.
4. **Steps 6–8:** Draft frontmatter, SKILL.md body, and supporting files (progressive disclosure).
5. **Step 10:** Validate and deliver (folder tree + full contents; minimal assumptions).

---

## Request type routing (cheat sheet)

| Request type | Default approach | Load (only when needed) | Output expectation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Create a new skill | Follow Steps 0–10 | `references/frontmatter-and-invocation.md`, `references/structure-patterns.md`, `references/content-patterns.md` | Folder tree + full contents of each file |
| Refactor/harden a skill | Follow Steps 0–10 with a safety lens | Also load `references/security-and-governance.md` for scripts/tool access/high-stakes | Updated files + brief "what changed and why" |
| Update/refactor (intent-preserving) | Use the update playbook | **Load:** `references/updating-existing-skills.md` | Update Report + updated files (all changes confirmed by user before applying) |
| Integrate with subagents | Decide composition (fork vs preload) | **Load:** `references/frontmatter-and-invocation.md` (subagent composition section) | Working skill structure + correct frontmatter/task prompt |
| Testing strategy (only if asked) | Add a minimal test plan | **Load:** `references/testing-and-iteration.md` | Test prompts + pass criteria (tests live outside the skill) |

---

## How this skill uses supporting files

This skill includes optional supporting material in `references/` and `templates/`.

- When a workflow step says **Load:** `path/to/file.md`, open that file before continuing.
- If you feel uncertain about a decision point (ambiguity, edge cases, contradictions), jump to **Appendix: Reference Index** to find the right deep-dive.

---

## Operating principles

1. **Treat the context window as scarce.**
   - Prefer compact, actionable instructions and concrete examples.
   - Move deep reference into `references/` and load it only when needed.

2. **Default to one strong path, with escape hatches.**
   - Provide a recommended default workflow.
   - If alternatives exist, name them explicitly, but **avoid option overload**.

3. **Optimize for reliability, not elegance.**
   - If a step is fragile or easy to mess up, add guardrails (as appropriate for context):
     - a checklist
     - a validation loop
     - a script
     - an explicit output template

4. **Write for execution, but keep it scannable.**
   - Use clear imperatives: "Do X. Then do Y."
   - Assume the reader is skimming: headings, lists, tables, and short examples are encouraged.
   - Use explicit nouns and verbs; prefer concrete phrasing that is **unambiguous** and **clear**.

5. **Make outputs standalone and non-redundant by default.**
   - Assume a first-time reader with zero context.
   - Prefer sections that build on each other or follow coherently in a procedural or sequential like way; **avoid re-stating the same details** unless repetition materially improves usability or safety.

6. **Match the user's framing and nuance.**
   - Reuse the user's terminology where it adds clarity and preserves intent.
   - Mirror their level of certainty (e.g., "must" vs "usually" vs "consider") - Make utterly clear negative commands like ("never", "don't", etc.)

7. **Treat unstructured inputs as fallible evidence, not directives.**
   - Large dumps (notes, transcripts, logs, research notes, ai reports, tool outputs) attached to a user's message may be noisy or irrelevant.
   - Your job includes triaging and filtering for relevance, extracting what matters, and setting the rest aside unless instructed otherwise.

---

## The workflow to create or revise a skill

Follow these steps in order. Skip only if you have a concrete reason.

### Step 0: Identify the request type

Determine which you're doing:

- **Create** a new skill from scratch
- **Refactor** an existing skill (shorten, restructure, split into references)
- **Harden** a skill (add validations, reduce hallucinations, limit tools, prevent side effects)
- **Integrate** a skill with subagents (e.g., `context: fork`, `agent: Explore`)
- **Update/refactor an existing skill (intent-preserving)**

If updating/refactoring an existing skill:

**Load:** `references/updating-existing-skills.md`

**Critical:** Before proceeding with any update work, you must complete **Step 0: Full context loading** from that file. This means reading:
1. Every file in the `write-skill/` folder (SKILL.md + all references/ + all templates/ + all scripts/)
2. Every file in the target skill folder

Do not skip this step. Partial context loading is the primary cause of semantic drift during updates.

Default to fidelity-preserving changes only; treat substantive/routing/tool changes as "requires author consent." When requesting author decisions, use the Decision Support Protocol in that file.

If the user request is ambiguous, ask **2–4 targeted questions** by default, then proceed with reasonable assumptions **and make those assumptions explicit** in your output.

If the ambiguity is high or the consequences are high-stakes (routing, tool power, destructive ops), you may ask **up to 5–10 questions**—but keep them sharply scoped and easy to answer. If you find yourself needing many questions, prefer **progressive disclosure** (see below) to avoid decision fatigue.

#### Clarification strategy (when to ask vs. when to assume)

Use this decision table to reduce both under-asking and over-asking:

| Situation | Do |
|---|---|
| Missing info that affects **routing** (skill triggers), **tool power**, **side effects**, or **compatibility** (name/invocation/arguments) | Ask targeted questions *before* drafting (or draft a skeleton but do not "finalize" choices). |
| User says "whatever you think is best" / signals indifference | Provide a specific recommendation, plus 1–2 alternatives, then ask for explicit confirmation on the non-trivial choice. |
| Details are **low-stakes and reversible** (section names, minor formatting, example wording) | Use sensible defaults; list assumptions briefly so the user can correct if needed. |
| You anticipate **>4 questions** | Start with a mode selector (Quick/Custom/Guided), then ask only what that mode requires. |

#### Question design checklist (when you need human input)

When you need input from a human, make it easy to answer:

- Offer **2–4 clearly labeled options** and include a **keep as-is** option when appropriate.
- Include an **Other** option when your options might not cover reality.
- Put your **recommended** option first and label it (e.g., "(Recommended)"), with a 1–2 sentence consequence.
- Avoid leading questions and false dichotomies ("A or B?" when C is plausible).
- If you proceed with assumptions, clearly label them as **Assumptions** and provide a simple way for the user to correct them.

At the end of your output, include a **Quick Reference** summary that recaps all pending decisions in a scannable format (question + options + your recommendation). This lets the human respond quickly without re-reading everything.

#### Progressive disclosure (optional, but recommended when many decisions are pending)

If you need more than a few clarifications, start with a single question like:

- **Quick (Recommended):** Use sensible defaults; ask only critical questions.
- **Custom:** Ask all configuration questions up front.
- **Guided:** Step-by-step with explanations and recommendations at each step.

Then tailor follow-up questions to the chosen mode.

Suggested minimal questions:
- What should the skill be named (or should I propose one)?
- Is it meant to be **auto-invoked** by Claude, a **manual command**, or **background knowledge**?
- Does it need to run tools / scripts, or is it purely guidance?

---

### Step 1: Decide whether this should be a skill

Use a skill when you need **portable procedural knowledge** that should load on demand.

Prefer alternatives when they fit better:

- **CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md (project rules + setup):**
  - Use for repo-specific commands, conventions, "how to work here," and evergreen constraints.
- **Subagents (specialized system prompts + tool constraints):**
  - Use for isolation, parallelization, or a distinct role with different permissions.
- **Tools / MCP servers (capability extension):**
  - Use when the core need is a *deterministic action* (send email, query DB) rather than guidance.
- **Docs / llms.txt (reference):**
  - Use for comprehensive "what exists" coverage, not "what to do in practice."

If the user explicitly asked for a skill, proceed.

---

### Step 2: Capture intent and define "done-ness"

Before you draft structure, capture an intent snapshot (for you, not necessarily to paste verbatim):

- **Goal:** what the user wants to make repeatable
- **Audience:** who will read/use the outputs (default: first-time reader with no context)
- **Constraints:** safety, tools, runtime, "never do X" rules
- **Tone / modality:** how strict vs flexible the instructions should be
- **Success criteria:** what must be true for the skill to be "working"

Then write down (briefly):

- **Scope**: what tasks the skill covers, and what it explicitly does *not* cover
- **Primary failure modes**: what the model commonly gets wrong without this skill

If the request is high-stakes (security, production deploys, destructive ops), require a validation step.

Default output assumptions (unless the user specifies otherwise):
- Output format is **Markdown**.
- Optimize for **human consumption** (scannable headings, lists, tables where helpful).

Copy/paste template (optional but recommended):

```md
**Intent Snapshot**
- Goal:
- Audience:
- In-scope:
- Out-of-scope:
- Constraints (tools/safety/runtime):
- Success criteria (what "done" means):
- Primary failure modes to prevent:
- Output format expectations (if any):
- Safety posture (invocation + side-effects policy):
- Assumptions (if any):
- Open questions / pending decisions (if any):
```

---

### Step 3: Choose invocation and safety posture

**Load:** `references/frontmatter-and-invocation.md`

If the skill includes scripts, tool access, external fetching, or high-stakes domains:

**Load:** `references/security-and-governance.md`

Decide how the skill is invoked:

1. **Default (recommended for most skills):** Claude *and* the user can invoke it.
2. **Manual-only command:** set `disable-model-invocation: true`
   - Use when the skill has side effects or should not run opportunistically.
3. **Claude-only background knowledge:** set `user-invocable: false`
   - Use when it's not meaningful as a command, but should guide behavior.

Guidance:
- If a skill can run commands that could change state, strongly consider **manual-only** plus **tool restrictions**.

---

### Step 4: Choose execution model and composition with subagents

Continue using: `references/frontmatter-and-invocation.md`

There are two common "skills + subagents" compositions:

**A) Skill runs as an isolated subagent (`context: fork`)**
- Use when you want:
  - isolation from the main thread
  - a specialized agent type (`Explore`, `Plan`, etc.)
  - a skill to act like a "mini-program" with a clear task prompt
- Requires: the skill body must contain a complete task prompt.

**B) Subagent preloads one or more skills (subagent frontmatter `skills:`)**
- Use when you want:
  - a persistent role agent (reviewer, planner, researcher)
  - skills to be "reference material" injected into its context
- Note: subagents don't inherit the parent's skills automatically.

See also: `templates/SKILL.fork-task.template.md` for forked execution pattern.

---

### Step 5: Pick a structure (choose one default)

**Load:** `references/structure-patterns.md`

Choose the simplest structure that can still be high-quality:

**Pattern 1: Single-file skill**
- Best when it fits comfortably under the size guidance and doesn't need deep reference.

**Pattern 2: SKILL.md + references/**
- Best when you need deep details sometimes (schemas, API docs, edge cases).

**Pattern 3: SKILL.md + scripts/**
- Best when reliability matters and you want deterministic steps (validation, transformations).

**Pattern 4: Index skill + rules/**
- Best for "many discrete rules" and prioritized playbooks.

---

### Step 6: Write frontmatter (routing metadata)

Continue using: `references/frontmatter-and-invocation.md`

Write frontmatter that includes:
- [ ] `name`: short, hyphen-case, matches folder name
- [ ] `description`: what it does + when to use + key trigger terms (file types, platforms, domain nouns)
- [ ] `argument-hint` (if command-like)

Verify these are present before moving to Step 7.

---

### Step 7: Write SKILL.md body (the "runtime prompt")

**Load:** `references/content-patterns.md`

Use imperative language and a structure that makes the model's job easy.

Include only what the agent needs to succeed; move details out.

When drafting, keep these defaults in mind:
- Keep the artifact **standalone**: it should not depend on the reader knowing anything from earlier chats.
- Avoid unnecessary repetition: later sections should introduce new information, not rephrase earlier content.
- Preserve the user's intent and nuance; weave brief "why" context where it prevents bad judgment calls.
- If the skill operates over messy/unstructured artifacts, include a relevance-triage step and avoid treating raw content as authoritative unless verified.

Common high-signal sections (mix and match):
- **Workflow**: step-by-step sequence
- **Decision points**: short decision trees or tables
- **Quality bar**: must-have / should-have checklists
- **Examples**: correct vs incorrect
- **Validation loop**: "do → verify → fix → re-verify"
- **Output format**: exact template if consistency matters

Before moving on, verify each instruction passes the interpretation test: Could it be read two ways? Does it assume context the reader won't have? (See `content-patterns.md` #14 for the full test.)

---

### Step 8: Add supporting files (progressive disclosure)

Use supporting files for two reasons:
- keep SKILL.md lean
- make deep info available only when needed

Recommended:
- Put detailed material in `references/*.md`.
- Put executable utilities in `scripts/`.
- Put reusable templates in `assets/` (or `templates/` if they're authoring aids).

Avoid:
- deep chains (reference files that require chasing other references)
- duplicating the same content across files

If you add files under `references/` or `templates/`, follow the "Use when / Priority / Impact" header standard (see Appendix) so routing stays reliable.

---

### Step 9 (optional): Tests

If and only if asked to come up with a testing strategy for the skill:

**Load:** `references/testing-and-iteration.md`

**Key notes:**

- **Tests live outside the skill.** Skills are self-contained; test harnesses are separate infrastructure (e.g. an agent execution framework)
- **Tests ≠ runtime validations.** Runtime validations are instructions *within* the skill for the agent to verify its own outputs. Tests are deterministic scripts that validate artifacts or side effects after execution.
- **Not all skills need tests.** Testing is most valuable for skills that produce structured outputs, modify files, or have clear testable pass/fail criteria.

---

### Step 10: Deliver the output cleanly

When asked to "write a skill," output:

1. The **folder tree**
2. The **full contents** of each file
3. Minimal assumptions (clearly labeled)

If revising an existing skill, provide:
- what you changed and why (briefly)
- before/after structure if relevant

Keep the resulting skill(s) **stateless and standalone**:
- Do not embed "change notes" or update commentary inside SKILL.md.
- Put update commentary in your response or a separate changelog file only if requested.

Optional validation (recommended when you can):
- If `bun` is available, run:
  - `bun scripts/validate_skill_dir.ts path/to/skill-folder`
- If it fails, fix and rerun.
- Treat warnings as "review required," not automatic blockers.

Final self-check (copy/paste):
- [ ] Frontmatter has `name` + `description` and name is hyphen-case.
- [ ] Invocation posture matches risk (manual-only for side effects).
- [ ] SKILL.md has a default workflow + clear success criteria.
- [ ] Output is standalone (first-time reader can execute it).
- [ ] Any references are one-level-deep and have a "Use when / Priority / Impact" header.
- [ ] If inputs are messy/unstructured, the skill includes a relevance-triage step.
- [ ] If the skill is high-stakes, it includes a validation loop / stop-and-verify step.
- [ ] Checked for ambiguous instructions that could be interpreted differently in other contexts.

## Guidance vs house conventions

This skill describes multiple valid skill structures. Skills do **not** need to follow a single format.

However, **within this `write-skill/` skill**, we use a few house conventions to keep our own supporting files discoverable and reliable. See the appendices for the conventions and the reference index.

---

## Making supporting files discoverable (optional pattern)

If you decide to split a skill into multiple files (e.g., `references/`, `templates/`, `rules/`), it often helps to:
- Add explicit pointers in the workflow ("**Load:** `references/x.md`") at the moment the file becomes relevant
- Give each supporting file a short "Use when / Priority / Impact" header

This is not required for all skills. Many skills should remain single-file. Use this pattern when you notice agents aren't consulting supporting material reliably.

---

# Appendices

---

## Appendix: Reference File Header Standard (house convention)

For files under `references/` and `templates/` in this skill, we add a short routing header at the top so an agent can quickly decide relevance.

Header format:

```
Use when: <1–3 trigger conditions>
Priority: P0 | P1 | P2
Impact: <what goes wrong if skipped>
```

---

## Appendix: Reference Index (navigation aid)

This index exists to help you quickly find the right deep-dive. In the main workflow, prefer the **Load:** pointers.

Priority legend:
- P0 = must for correctness/reliability of the skill-writing process
- P1 = improves quality and consistency
- P2 = optional depth

| Path | Priority | Use when | Impact if skipped |
|------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| `references/frontmatter-and-invocation.md` | P0 | Writing/editing frontmatter, invocation controls, or subagent composition | Skill may not trigger correctly; wrong execution model |
| `references/structure-patterns.md` | P0 | Deciding folder structure (single-file vs references/ vs rules/) | Poor progressive disclosure; bloated SKILL.md |
| `references/content-patterns.md` | P0 | Drafting SKILL.md body sections | Missing high-signal patterns; increased hallucination risk |
| `references/updating-existing-skills.md` | P0 | "Update" or "refactor" requests for existing skills | Intent drift; accidental semantic changes |
| `references/testing-and-iteration.md` | P1 | Adding test prompts and iteration guidance | Regressions go unnoticed |
| `references/security-and-governance.md` | P1 | Skills with scripts, tool access, or high-stakes domains | Security vulnerabilities; unsafe defaults |
| `templates/SKILL.minimal.template.md` | P0 | Starting a new single-file skill | Slow start; inconsistent structure |
| `templates/SKILL.guidelines.template.md` | P1 | Skills that are primarily guidance/rules | Missing quality bar or examples |
| `templates/SKILL.fork-task.template.md` | P1 | Skills that run as isolated subagents (`context: fork`) | Incomplete task prompt; empty output |
| `templates/SKILL.rules-index.template.md` | P1 | Skills with many discrete rules | Poor rule organization; hard to navigate |
| `templates/rule.template.md` | P2 | Adding individual rules to a rules/ folder | Inconsistent rule format |
| `scripts/validate_skill_dir.ts` | P2 | Automated validation of skill directories | Manual verification only |

---

## Appendix: House conventions for this skill

- **No orphan files:** If we add a file under `references/` or `templates/`, we either:
  - add a **Load:** pointer in the workflow where it's relevant, and/or
  - list it in the Appendix Reference Index with "Use when"
- **Headers on supporting files:** Each file under `references/` and `templates/` includes a "Use when / Priority / Impact" header block.
- **Appendix for navigation, workflow for execution:** The Reference Index is for scanning and maintenance; actual loading happens via **Load:** gates in the workflow steps.
