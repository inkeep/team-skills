# PR Review Output Contract

## Intent

This skill defines **how to format your output** when returning findings.

Goals:
- **machine-parseable** — output can be `JSON.parse()`'d directly
- **self-describing** — each finding declares its type and scope
- **actionable** — structured issue + implications + fixes

Preload this skill via `skills: [pr-review-output-contract]` into any `pr-review-*` agent.

## Scope

**This contract covers:** Your return format (the JSON you output)

**Out of scope:** File discovery, diff computation, or how you analyze code

---

## Finding Types

Findings are a **discriminated union** based on the `type` field. Choose the type that matches the **scope** of your finding.

| Type | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `inline` | Specific line(s), proposed fix, small scope |
| `file` | Whole-file concern, no specific line |
| `multi-file` | Cross-cutting issue spanning multiple files |
| `system` | Architectural/pattern concern, no specific files |

### Decision Tree

```
Is this about a specific line or small line range (≤20 lines)?
├─ YES → Can you propose a fix?
│        ├─ YES, unambiguous   → type: "inline" (fix_confidence: HIGH)
│        ├─ YES, but uncertain → type: "inline" (fix_confidence: MEDIUM/LOW)
│        └─ NO fix, just guidance → type: "file"
└─ NO  → Does this involve specific files?
         ├─ YES → How many files?
         │        ├─ ONE  → type: "file"
         │        └─ MANY → type: "multi-file"
         └─ NO  → type: "system" (pattern/architectural)
```

---

## Output Rules

### R1. Return valid JSON only

- Use **double quotes** for strings and keys.
- No comments, no trailing commas.
- No surrounding prose, headings, or code fences.

Your output must be directly parseable via `JSON.parse()`.

### R2. Return a JSON array of Finding objects

Always return an array, even if empty:

```json
[]
```

### R3. Use the correct type for each finding

The `type` field determines which other fields are required. Do not mix schemas.

---

## Finding Schemas

### Common Fields (All Types)

These fields are **required on all finding types**.

| # | Field | Type | Description |
|---|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | `type` | `"inline"` \| `"file"` \| `"multi-file"` \| `"system"` | Discriminator. Determines schema shape. |
| 2 | `category` | string | Your domain (e.g., `"standards"`, `"architecture"`). |
| 3 | `issue` | string | What's wrong. Thorough description. |
| 4 | `references` | string[] | **Required.** Citations that justify both the finding and the proposed fix. See Reference Types below. |
| 5 | `implications` | string | Why it matters. Consequence, risk, user impact. (write AFTER citing evidence) |
| 6 | `severity` | `"CRITICAL"` \| `"MAJOR"` \| `"MINOR"` \| `"INFO"` | How serious is this issue? (classify AFTER implications) |
| 7 | `confidence` | `"HIGH"` \| `"MEDIUM"` \| `"LOW"` | How certain are you this is a real issue? (rate AFTER citing evidence) |
| 8 | `fix` | string | Suggestion[s] for how to address it. If simple, give the full solution as a code block. If bigger-scoped, interweave brief code examples into the explanation. Don't over-engineer — give a starting point/direction. |
| 9 | `fix_confidence` | `"HIGH"` \| `"MEDIUM"` \| `"LOW"` | How confident are you in the proposed fix? |
| 10 | `pre_existing` | boolean | **(Optional.)** Set to `true` if this issue existed before this PR — it was NOT introduced by the PR's changes. Omit or set `false` for issues introduced by the PR. See guidance below. |

### Reference Types

Every finding **must** include at least one reference (outside of the line numbers a suggestion applies to). References ground and justify both the issue and the proposed fix in verifiable sources, and prevent hallucinated recommendations.

**Important:** References are **not** for pointing to the file or lines where the finding is located — the finding's own `file` and `line` fields already capture that. Instead, references cite **other sources** that justify *why* the finding is valid and *why* the fix is appropriate: related code elsewhere in the codebase, project standards (skills, AGENTS.md), reviewer-defined rules, or external documentation.

**In-repo reference rule:** All references to files within this repo (code, skills, AGENTS.md, reviewer agents, etc.) **must** include specific line number(s) and a brief (<1 sentence) description of what's at those lines that relates to the issue or fix. This makes the reasoning traceable — a reader should be able to click through and immediately see the justification.

**Use markdown hyperlinks** `[text](url)` for ALL references. The `pr-context` skill provides the GitHub URL base pattern for constructing links.

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Related code** | `[file:line — what's there](url#Lline)` | `[src/api/users.ts:28 — parameterized query pattern](https://github.com/.../src/api/users.ts#L28)` |
| **Related code range** | `[file:start-end — what's there](url#Lstart-Lend)` | `[utils.ts:10-15 — shared validation helpers](https://github.com/.../utils.ts#L10-L15)` |
| **Skill reference** | `[skill:Lstart-Lend — what's there](url#Lstart-Lend)` | `[pr-review-security-iam skill:L45-L52 — credential rotation checklist](https://github.com/.../.agents/skills/.../SKILL.md#L45-L52)` |
| **AGENTS.md rule** | `[AGENTS.md:Lline — what's there](url#Lline)` | `[AGENTS.md:L142 — tenant isolation rule](https://github.com/.../AGENTS.md#L142)` |
| **Reviewer instructions** | `[reviewer:Lstart-Lend — what's there](url#Lstart-Lend)` | `[pr-review-security-iam:L28-L35 — auth bypass checklist](https://github.com/.../.claude/agents/pr-review-security-iam.md#L28-L35)` |
| **External URL** | `[descriptive text](url)` | `[React useMemo docs](https://react.dev/...)` |

**Constructing GitHub URLs:**

Use the pattern from `pr-context`:
```
https://github.com/{repo}/blob/{sha}/{path}#L{line}
https://github.com/{repo}/blob/{sha}/{path}#L{start}-L{end}
```

**Examples:**
```json
{
  "references": [
    "[src/api/users.ts:28-35 — parameterized query pattern](https://github.com/org/repo/blob/abc123/src/api/users.ts#L28-L35)",
    "[pr-review-security-iam skill:L45-L52 — credential rotation checklist](https://github.com/org/repo/blob/abc123/.agents/skills/pr-review-security-iam/SKILL.md#L45-L52)",
    "[pr-review-security-iam:L28-L35 — auth bypass checklist](https://github.com/org/repo/blob/abc123/.claude/agents/pr-review-security-iam.md#L28-L35)",
    "[OWASP SQL Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection)"
  ]
}
```

**Guidance:**
- **Code issues** → link to *related* code elsewhere that demonstrates the correct pattern or exposes the inconsistency (with line(s) + description)
- **Standards violations** → link to the AGENTS.md rule at the specific line(s) that define the standard (with description)
- **Skill-backed findings** → link to the skill at the specific line(s) that define the pattern or checklist (with description)
- **Reviewer-defined rules** → link to your own agent file at the specific line(s) of the relevant checklist item (with description)
- **Best practice claims** → link to official docs or authoritative sources (external URLs don't need line numbers)
- **Justify both issue and fix** → include references that support *why* the issue matters AND *why* the proposed fix is appropriate. E.g., link to an existing pattern that the fix follows, or to docs that prescribe the recommended approach.
- **Multiple references** are encouraged when they strengthen the finding
---

### Type: `inline`

**Use when:** You found an issue at a specific line (or small range ≤20 lines) AND you can propose a fix. Set `fix_confidence` to reflect certainty — `HIGH` for drop-in fixes, `MEDIUM`/`LOW` when the fix needs adjustment or verification.

**Field order:** `type` → `file` → `line` → common fields (category → issue → references → implications → severity → confidence → fix → fix_confidence)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `type` | `"inline"` | Literal string. |
| `file` | string | Repo-relative path (e.g., `"src/api/client.ts"`). |
| `line` | number \| string | Line number (`42`) or range (`"42-48"`). |
| `line_end` | number | (Optional) Explicit end line (alternative to range string). |

---

### Type: `file`

**Use when:** The issue concerns a whole file, a large section, or you have guidance but not a concrete line-level fix.

**Field order:** `type` → `file` → common fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `type` | `"file"` | Literal string. |
| `file` | string | Repo-relative path. |

---

### Type: `multi-file`

**Use when:** The issue spans multiple files — e.g., inconsistency between API and SDK, type definitions out of sync, or a pattern that appears across several files.

**Field order:** `type` → `files` → common fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `type` | `"multi-file"` | Literal string. |
| `files` | string[] | Array of repo-relative paths (at least 2). |

---

### Type: `system`

**Use when:** The issue is architectural or pattern-related, not tied to specific files — e.g., inconsistent patterns across the codebase, precedent-setting concerns, or design decisions that affect evolvability.

**Field order:** `type` → `scope` → common fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `type` | `"system"` | Literal string. |
| `scope` | string | Brief description of what area/pattern this concerns. |

---

## Field Semantics

### `severity`

Use the smallest severity that is still honest. Severity indicates **impact**, not certainty.

| Severity | Meaning | Merge Impact |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `CRITICAL` | Security or AuthN, Authz, or IAM vulnerability, data loss or corruption, breaking change or broken core functionality, likely incident | Blocks merge |
| `MAJOR` | Core standard violation, likely bug, not addressing all product or internal surface areas that changes affect (e.g. missing docs), correctness issue, likely to face issues in deployments or cause failures, etc. | Fix before merge |
| `MINOR` | Internal devex improvements, minor consistency or maintainability issues, plausible but potentially unlikely scenarios, nitpicks, "would be better if…", functionally OK but could use cleaner implementation, etc. Must still be "any reasonable engineer would agree that this is a valid strict improvement". | Can merge; developer discretion.  |
| `INFO` | Informational notes, non-actionable observations, or 50/50 developer discretion/preference. | No action required |

### `confidence`

How certain you are that this is a real issue. Not how severe it is.

| Confidence | Meaning | Evidence Level |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| `HIGH` | Definite issue. Evidence is unambiguous in the code/diff and clearly problematic or would be identified as a real issue by experienced engineers. | "I can point to the exact line and explain why it's wrong." |
| `MEDIUM` | Likely issue. Reasonable alternate interpretation exists. | "This looks wrong, but there might be context I'm missing." |
| `LOW` | Possible issue. Needs human confirmation or more context. | "This could be a problem, but I'm not sure." |

### `fix_confidence`

How confident you are in the proposed fix. Distinct from `confidence` (issue certainty).

| Fix Confidence | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| `HIGH` | Fix is drop-in: complete, correct, includes necessary imports/types, doesn't introduce new issues. **Requires web search verification when the fix changes third-party library/framework usage** (see `pr-review-check-suggestion` Step F2) or reference to other existing code in the existing codebase that illustrates the correct approach. Default to `MEDIUM` until substantiated. Only exception are self-evident fixes (null checks, typos, simple refactors) that are intrinsically obvious (rare). |
| `MEDIUM` | Fix is directionally correct but may need certain details confirmed by developer. |
| `LOW` | Fix is a starting point but not sure about exact approach given context; human should verify approach. |

### `category`

Use **your primary domain**. This is a freeform string. Examples:

| Category | Domain |
|----------|--------|
| `standards` | code quality, bugs, AGENTS.md compliance |
| `security` | authn/authz, injection, data exposure |
| `architecture` | patterns, abstractions, system design |
| `customer-impact` | API contracts, breaking changes, UX |
| `tests` | coverage, test quality, flaky tests |
| `docs` | documentation quality, accuracy |
| `breaking-changes` | schema, migrations, env variables |
| `types` | type design, invariants |
| `errors` | error handling, silent failures |
| `comments` | comment accuracy, staleness |
| `frontend` | React/Next.js patterns, components |
| `sre` | reliability, retries, timeouts, circuit breakers, observability |
| `llm` | AI/LLM integration: tools, templates, streaming, context management |

**Cross-domain findings:** If you find an issue outside your domain, don't flag it unless it has valid cross-over to your domain. And if so, therefore still mark it as a category that corresponds to your domain.

### `pre_existing` (optional)

Indicates whether the issue existed **before** this PR — it was not introduced by the PR's changes. Defaults to `false` (omit the field entirely for issues introduced by the PR).

**This is purely opportunistic.** Your primary job is reviewing what this PR introduces or changes. Do NOT actively search for pre-existing issues or spend cycles hunting for tech debt. Only flag something as `pre_existing: true` if it stood out while you were doing your normal review but is not in the natural scope of the PR. Keep scoped to significant (crticial/major) high confidence findings.

### `issue`, `implications`, `fix`

Scale depth with severity × confidence. Lean detailed — thorough analysis and specific resolutions or suggestions to consider are better than vague!

| Severity × Confidence | issue | implications | fix |
|-----------------------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| CRITICAL + HIGH | Full context: what, where, how it happens | Detailed consequences, attack scenarios, blast radius | Concrete fix with code example, before/after |
| MAJOR + HIGH | Specific description with relevant context | Clear consequences, who/what is affected | Concrete fix, code if non-obvious |
| MAJOR + MEDIUM | Clear description of the problem | 1-2 sentences on impact | Actionable suggestion |
| MINOR / LOW | Brief description | Brief impact | Brief suggestion |

---

## Normalization Rules

### N1. One issue per finding

Do not bundle multiple unrelated issues. Split them into separate findings.

### N2. Choose the right type

If you're unsure between types:
- `inline` vs `file`: Use `inline` when you can point to a specific line and propose a fix (even with `fix_confidence: MEDIUM/LOW`). Use `file` when the issue is whole-file or you have guidance but no specific line to anchor to.
- `file` vs `multi-file`: If only one file is affected, use `file`. If the issue is the *relationship* between files, use `multi-file`.
- `multi-file` vs `system`: If you can enumerate the specific files, use `multi-file`. If it's about a pattern that could affect *any* file, use `system`.

### N3. No duplicates

If two findings describe the same issue differently, keep the more actionable one.

### N4. Repo-relative paths only

Never use absolute paths. Always use paths relative to the repository root.
