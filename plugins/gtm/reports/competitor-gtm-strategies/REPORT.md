**Founders**: Bret Taylor (ex-Salesforce Co-CEO, co-creator of Google Maps, OpenAI Chairman) + Clay Bavor (ex-Google VP, led Gmail, Drive, VR)

**Stage**: $0 → $100M ARR (7 quarters — one of fastest enterprise software companies ever)

| Milestone | Timeline | Key Metric |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Launch** | February 2024 | Stealth to public |
| **$26M ARR** | End of 2024 | ~10 months |
| **$100M ARR** | November 2025 | 7 quarters |
| **$150M ARR** | January 2026 | First $50M quarter |
| **Valuation** | $10B | $635M total funding |

#### The Sierra GTM Playbook

**1. Founder Credibility as Distribution**

| Founder | Credibility Asset | GTM Impact |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| **Bret Taylor** | Co-CEO Salesforce, CTO Facebook, co-created Google Maps, OpenAI Chairman | Instant enterprise trust |
| **Clay Bavor** | 20 years at Google, led Gmail/Drive/VR | Technical credibility |
| **Network** | Many early customers had Bret's phone number | Direct founder-to-CXO sales |

**Key Quote**: "I learned from Marc Benioff to make one successful customer into two, two into 10, and 10 into 100."

---

**2. Enterprise-First, High-Touch Model**

| Tactic | Details | Evidence |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Build FOR customers, not WITH** | Sierra builds custom AI agents for each enterprise | Opposite of self-serve |
| **Strategic partner positioning** | "Partner, not vendor of plug-and-play solutions" | Multi-year agreements |
| **C-suite relationships** | Direct founder access to early adopters | "Many customers have Bret's phone number" |
| **Fast deployment** | One healthcare company went live in 7 weeks | High-touch = fast results |

**Customer Profile**:
- 50% of customers have revenue >$1B
- 25% of customers have revenue >$10B
- Fortune 500 and legacy enterprises, not startups

---

**3. Outcomes-Based Pricing (Revolutionary)**

| Model | How It Works | Why It Matters |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Pay per resolution** | Customer pays pre-negotiated rate when AI resolves issue | Aligns cost with value |
| **Escalation is free** | If AI escalates to human, no charge | De-risks adoption |
| **Hybrid approach** | Volume-based for routine, outcomes-based for complex | Flexibility for enterprise |

**Key Quote**: "When the AI agent resolves the issue autonomously, there's a pre-negotiated rate. If they escalate to a person, it's free."

**Competitive Advantage**: Legacy vendors (Zendesk, Salesforce, Intercom) retrofitting AI onto seat-based models. Sierra's outcomes-based approach creates alignment competitors can't match.

---

**4. Voice-First Strategy**

| Channel | Status | Impact |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Voice agents** | Surpassed text as primary channel by Sept 2025 | Addresses 80% of CX interactions |
| **Hundreds of millions of calls** | Processed by Sept 2025 | Scale validation |
| **Expansion driver** | Voice expansion drives customer growth | New revenue stream |

---

**5. Market Positioning: "Jobs to Be Done" vs "AI Tourism"**

Sierra differentiates between:
- **AI Tourism**: Technology-first experiments that don't drive business outcomes
- **Jobs to Be Done**: Business-outcome focused deployments with measurable impact

**Result**: Focus on complex use cases (mortgage origination, real estate search, subscription management) where AI agents deliver measurable ROI.

---

#### Key Customers

| Category | Companies | Significance |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Fintech** | SoFi, Ramp, Brex, Rocket Mortgage | 70% of fintech value chain |

| **Media** | SiriusXM, DIRECTV, Tubi | 90% of media ecosystem |
| **Consumer** | ADT, Sonos, WeightWatchers, Rivian | Legacy + internet-era mix |

| Series C | $350M | $10B | Greenoaks |
| **Total** | **$635M** | **$10B** | — |

---

#### Key Insights for Inkeep

1. **Founder credibility accelerates enterprise sales** — Bret's network and reputation enabled direct C-suite access from day one

2. **High-touch beats self-serve for enterprise** — Building custom solutions for each customer created stickiness and higher ACVs

3. **Outcomes-based pricing aligns incentives** — "Pay per resolution, escalation is free" de-risks enterprise adoption

4. **Voice is the next frontier** — 80% of CX still happens via phone; voice agents are expansion opportunity

5. **Target $1B+ revenue companies** — 50% of Sierra customers exceed $1B revenue; enterprise-first from start

**Warning for Inkeep**: Sierra's model requires significant founder credibility and implementation resources. Not directly replicable without similar network/team.

6. **Compliance as unlock** — SOC 2 + GDPR removes enterprise adoption friction

**Relevance for Inkeep**: Gumloop's extreme efficiency narrative and angel-to-customer strategy offers a replicable playbook. Their no-code approach targets different users (operations teams vs developers) but their GTM efficiency is instructive.
