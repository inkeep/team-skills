## Findings

### Finding: The SUCCESs Model (Made to Stick) provides actionable principles for memorable content
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Heath Brothers framework + multiple marketing adaptations

The SUCCESs acronym:
- **Simple** — Find the core message and strip away everything else
- **Unexpected** — Violate expectations to grab attention
- **Concrete** — Use sensory language and specific details
- **Credible** — Include proof points and external validation
- **Emotional** — Make readers feel something
- **Stories** — Embed information in narrative

**Key Quote:** "Simplicity is the essence of good writing... it's your job as a writer to carefully select the right words and delete clutter."

**Implications for Compass:** The current system optimizes for Simple and Concrete but systematically avoids Unexpected (formulaic structure), Emotional (enterprise-speak), and Stories (bullet-point driven).

### Finding: StoryBrand's "Customer as Hero" framework inverts typical B2B positioning
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** StoryBrand.com, multiple B2B implementations

Core principle: "Stop being the hero of your own story—your customer is the hero, and you are the guide."

The SB7 Framework:
1. **A character** (customer) has a **problem**
2. And meets a **guide** (brand) who gives them a **plan**
3. And calls them to **action** that ends in **success** and helps them avoid **failure**

**Key Quote:** "In most B2B situations, customers experience feelings of being overwhelmed, frustrated, unsure, or confused... consequences typically look like losing money, wasting time, increasing stress."

**Implications for Compass:** Current templates position Inkeep as the hero ("How we help," "Our solution"). StoryBrand would restructure to: "You (VP Support) face X problem → Here's a framework → Avoid Y failure → Achieve Z success."

### Finding: Dan Harmon's Story Circle provides a simpler alternative to Hero's Journey
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Boords, Reedsy, StudioBinder breakdowns

The 8 steps:
1. **You** — Character in comfort zone
2. **Need** — They want something
3. **Go** — Enter unfamiliar situation
4. **Search** — Adapt, find what works
5. **Find** — Get what they wanted
6. **Take** — Pay the price
7. **Return** — Back to familiar
8. **Change** — Now capable of change

**Key Quote:** "The Story Circle is descriptive, not prescriptive—it doesn't tell you what to write, but how to tell the story."

**Implications for Compass:** Blog content could follow a reader transformation arc: "You're doing X → You need Y → Here's the search → Here's the find → Here's the cost → Here's your new capability."

### Finding: AIDA and narrative storytelling are complementary, not competing
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** HubSpot, Brafton, Siege Media analyses

AIDA = Attention → Interest → Desire → Action

**Key Insight:** "The AIDA model shares elements with great storytelling... storytelling becomes incredibly powerful during the Desire phase, where features become benefits and benefits become personal outcomes."

**Limitation:** "AIDA lacks mechanisms for deepening consumer relationships through personalization, which are critical for long-term loyalty."

**Implications for Compass:** Current system follows AIDA structure (Decision-first = Attention, Framework = Interest, How We Help = Desire, CTA = Action) but misses the narrative layer that makes Desire work.

## Synthesis: Framework Selection for B2B Technical Content

| Framework | Best For | Compass Gap |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| SUCCESs | Making content memorable | Missing Unexpected, Emotional, Stories |
| StoryBrand | Positioning and messaging | Customer isn't the hero |
| Story Circle | Reader transformation | No character arc |
| AIDA | Conversion optimization | Structure without soul |

**Recommendation:** Layer SUCCESs principles on top of existing AIDA-like structure, using StoryBrand positioning (customer as hero) and Story Circle for narrative arc within sections.

## Gaps / Follow-ups

- Need to analyze how these frameworks translate to technical/developer audiences specifically
- Should examine how top technical blogs (Stripe, Linear) apply these implicitly
