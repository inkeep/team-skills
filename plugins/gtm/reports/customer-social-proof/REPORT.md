# Customer Social Proof Reference

**Purpose:** Quick reference for selecting the right customer names to use as social proof in cold outreach. Match customers by industry, company size, and persona for maximum relevance.

## How to Use This Document

1. **Identify prospect's industry** from the vertical tables below
2. **Match company size** — use customers of similar scale
3. **Cross-reference with persona** — some customers resonate more with specific roles
4. **Use 1-2 names max** — keep it to one short line in emails

**Insertion patterns:**
- "Teams like **{Customer A}** and **{Customer B}** use Inkeep to..."
- "We work with teams like **{Customer}** on..."
- "If helpful, I can share what worked for **{Customer}**."
