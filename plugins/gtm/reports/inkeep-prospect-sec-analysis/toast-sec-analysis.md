**Key Risk Disclosures:**

- **Scaling Support Operations:** Toast serves approximately 164,000 restaurant locations with continued rapid growth (28,000+ net adds in 2024, 30,000 in 2025). Support operations must scale to match this growth trajectory.

- **Customer Acquisition Dependence:** Per SEC filings, "Toast's future revenue depends in large part on its success in attracting additional customers to its platform." Customer support quality directly impacts retention and acquisition.
