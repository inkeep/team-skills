## 1. Risk Factors Analysis (Item 1A)

### 1.1 Customer Support/Service Challenges

**Key Risk Disclosures:**
- **Rapid Growth Scaling:** "Zscaler has a history of rapid revenue and other growth in recent periods, which may not be indicative of future performance." The company must scale support operations to match 20-30%+ annual growth.
- **Service Level Commitments:** Zscaler commits to "99.9% availability of the total hours during every month" per their SLA, creating operational pressure on support teams.
- **Professional Services Capacity:** "Professional and other services... consist primarily of fees associated with mapping, implementation, network design and training" - though immaterial to revenue, these services are critical to customer success.

**Inkeep Opportunity:**
- AI-powered support could help maintain SLA commitments during rapid scaling
- Documentation AI could reduce support ticket volume for common implementation questions
- Self-service knowledge tools could augment professional services capacity

### 1.2 Documentation/Knowledge Management Gaps

**Identified Challenges:**
- **Complex Product Portfolio:** Zscaler operates across ZIA (Internet Access), ZPA (Private Access), ZDX (Digital Experience), and multiple emerging products requiring extensive documentation
- **Land-and-Expand Model:** "Some of their customers initially use their services for specific users or specific security functionality" - requiring progressive documentation and enablement
- **Multi-Regional Operations:** With "4,595 employees located outside the United States" (primarily India), knowledge sharing across time zones is critical

**Evidence from Filings:**
- Support structure includes multiple tiers: Support Essentials, Support Plus, Premium Support, Premium Support Advanced, Premium Support Advanced Plus
- Customer Success Center and Help Portal (help.zscaler.com) serve as primary knowledge resources

**Inkeep Opportunity:**
- Content intelligence for documentation across complex product suite
- AI agent for customer self-service across support tiers
- Knowledge management across distributed global teams

### 1.3 AI/Automation Initiatives

**Current AI Strategy (Major Investment Area):**

Zscaler is heavily investing in AI across three pillars:
