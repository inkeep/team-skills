# B2B Persona Messaging Playbook

**Purpose:** Provide actionable, evidence-backed guidance for crafting cold email messaging that resonates with specific B2B personas. This playbook maps target personas to 19 researched archetypes, with detailed insights on what each persona cares about and how to reach them effectively.

---

## Executive Summary

This playbook provides deep research on 19 distinct B2B persona archetypes. Each archetype includes:

1. **Role responsibilities** — What they own and how success is defined
2. **Key metrics/KPIs** — What numbers determine their career trajectory
3. **Day-to-day activities** — How they spend their time
4. **Pain points & priorities** — What keeps them up at night
5. **Buying behavior** — How they evaluate vendors and make decisions
6. **Content consumption** — What they read, listen to, and trust
7. **Messaging angle** — Problem framing, proof points, and CTAs that work
8. **Anti-patterns** — What turns them off and kills response rates

**Key Findings:**

- **Interest-based CTAs double response rates** — "Would it be helpful to see..." outperforms "Book a demo" (30% vs 15% response rate)
- **Narrow targeting wins** — Targeting 1 person per company yields 7.8% reply rate vs 3.8% for 10+ people
- **Budget authority varies dramatically by level** — VPs have it; Managers influence but may need approval
- **Content consumption is role-specific** — Each persona has distinct trusted sources and formats
- **Developer-adjacent personas are skeptical** — They identify as practitioners first and detect sales tactics instantly
- **ROI proof is the universal VP-level challenge** — Connect every claim to measurable business outcomes

## Inkeep Market Pain Points (CEO Framing)

When mapping personas to Inkeep's value proposition, anchor on these two core pain points:

### Pain Point 1: Fragmented AI Solutions

> *"Technical B2B SaaS companies are aiming to adopt AI to accelerate and improve every step of the customer journey. To do so, they are adopting a mix of AI solutions to cover different company-specific workflows and use cases covering everything from product onboarding, support engineering, success, and content teams. The problem: system of record platforms like support platforms often have siloed "closed garden" AI functionality that just doesn't work that well or doesn't connect or interface with a company's knowledge sources, customer data, 1st party product APIs and apps, or the other 3rd party SaaS solutions that the customer may use. Companies find themselves purchasing piece-meal solutions from specialized vendors (often startups) that solve narrow scenarios (e.g. "support chatbot") or workflows ("turn support tickets into documentation updates"). These solutions don't talk to each other, are configured and behave differently, or just don't quite work well in the specific requirements, data sources, workflows, or use cases unique to a company (and every company has a unique combination of these). Any limitation turns into a feature request to 1 vendor which may or may not get prioritized, and you're bottlenecked by that vendor's ability to ship features or make their solution extensible (which is often not a priority). This piecemeal approach poses significant burden on vendor procurement, security and governance, and actual adoption across every CX-related function of the company."*
> — Nick Mishra, CEO

### Pain Point 2: Support Engineers Don't Get to Spend Time on Tough Problems

> *"In B2B SaaS companies, support is part of the product. B2B SaaS companies gravitate towards Enterprise sales motions, so providing a great customer experience and keeping individual customers happy is often a basic expectation of any of their Enterprise customers. Similarly, for product-led companies, support and a great user experience is imperative to promoting word of mouth and organic growth. Because of these dynamics, B2B SaaS companies invest heavily and see as a requirement to deliver timely, accurate, top-notch support. Delivering this support often relies on highly specialized talent including dedicated support engineers or engineering members of their product team. These engineers have to become always-up-to-date product experts (which has a ramp up period and is hard to hire for), but also need to spend significant amount of time performing **workflows** to help gather all the right context to resolve a problem. This often includes gathering additional context from the user, looking up customer information in downstream systems like error logs, CRMs, 1st party product-specific data sources or APIs, cross-referencing information with engineering and product backlogs, etc. All of these systems are often varied, and the workflows that stem from them are often custom to the company and how it operates. AI Support solutions today often **don't** cover anything beyond product knowledge chat Q&A, and even there, often don't handle the varied knowledge sources of a technical B2B SaaS company (knowledge base, docs, github, internal KBs like confluence, marketing site, etc.). The result: technical B2B SaaS companies struggle to adopt AI in a meaningful way beyond chat Q&A; keeping time-to-resolution stats high and support and product engineering teams swamped with the more manual and tedious parts of support."*

  - "Your team is juggling 6+ tools to manage CX — what if you could consolidate?"
  - "Integration gaps mean agents are copy-pasting between systems instead of helping customers"

## Part 7: Universal Cold Email Best Practices

### What Works Across All Personas

| Practice | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Interest-based CTAs | 30% response rate vs 15% for direct booking |
| Question-phrased CTAs | Double reply rates |
| Personalized CTAs | 202% better conversion than generic |
| Narrow targeting (1 person) | 7.8% reply rate vs 3.8% for 10+ |
| Short emails (50-125 words) | Optimal length for cold outreach |
| Specific date/time CTAs | Double meeting bookings (15% → 37%) |
| Multi-channel (email + LinkedIn) | ~30% reply rates |
| Scheduling links | 1.5x more meetings |

### What Fails Across All Personas

| Anti-Pattern | Impact |
|--------------|--------|
| Generic templates | Spotted instantly; trust destroyed |
| Spray-and-pray (10+ people) | Reply rate drops from 7.8% to 3.8% |
| Long emails (500+ words) | Executives skim in 5-7 seconds |
| Talking about ROI | Reduces success by 15% — show, don't tell |
| HTML-heavy formatting | Plain text outperforms |
| Monday outreach | Only 5.29% reply rate |
| Excessive follow-ups | Cap at 5 max |
| Guilt-tripping follow-ups | "I never heard back" decreases meetings by 14% |

### Follow-Up Strategy

- **Email 2 is highest-leverage** — +49% reply lift
- **4+ sentence follow-ups** get 15x more meetings vs. lazy one-liners
- **Optimal sequence:** Pain > Proof > Bump > Re-Angle > Value-Add > Objection Preempt > Breakup
- **Breakup emails** achieve 33-76% response rate

### CTA Examples by Persona Level

| Level | CTA Approach |
|-------|-------------|
| **Executive (VP+)** | "Worth a quick 15-minute chat?" / "Mind if I send a 2-min Loom?" |
| **Director/Manager** | "See how [similar company] achieved X" / "Happy to share our benchmark report" |
| **IC/Individual Contributor** | "Try free" / "Here's a template you can use today" |
| **Technical roles** | "Technical deep-dive available" / "See our API docs" |
