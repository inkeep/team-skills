## Findings

### Finding: VP of CX is a Strategic Cross-Functional Role, Not Just a Support Leader
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** ClearAction, CustomerThink, Deloitte Digital all define VP CX as responsible for facilitating customer experience excellence throughout the ENTIRE company, with a vision that includes alignment to strategic customer segments and seamless, transparent experience that sustains mutual growth.

**Key Distinction from VP of Customer Success:**
- VP CX: Owns the end-to-end customer journey across ALL departments (marketing, sales, product, support)
- VP CS: Focused primarily on post-sale retention and expansion

**Implications:** Messaging must address cross-functional mandate and organization-wide influence, not just support metrics.

---

### Finding: Revenue Impact is the #1 CEO Expectation from CCOs in 2025
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** CMSWire reports "The C-suite wants revenue impact, operational efficiency and measurable growth from CX investments." CEOs and CCOs have identified "excellence in execution, customer loyalty and retention, and top-line growth" as top priorities.

**Revenue Impact Materializes Through:**
1. Customer retention — sustainable recurring revenue vs. replacing churned accounts
2. Internal growth — upsells, cross-sells, referral marketing
3. Cost reduction — operational efficiency in service delivery

**Implications:** Position tools as revenue drivers, not cost centers. Connect every claim to bottom-line outcomes.

---

### Finding: Budget Constraints Rose to #2 Challenge for CXOs in 2024
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** CCO Council reports "Securing sufficient budget to execute on brand experience strategy rose from #9 of 12 challenges last year to the #2 spot for the 2024 cohort."

**Implications:** Be sensitive to budget constraints; emphasize ROI and cost-effectiveness.

---

### Finding: Measuring ROI is the Persistent Challenge
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Deloitte Digital and CCO Council both cite ROI measurement as a core challenge. "An alarming majority of businesses cannot calculate their CX ROI, while too many fail to connect CX efforts to their bottom line."

CXOs' second most cited time spent is "identifying and tracking the right metrics."

**Implications:** Provide clear ROI frameworks, measurement tools, and case studies with dollar figures.

---

### Finding: Resistance to Change is the Greatest Challenge
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** CCO Council: "CCOs find that resistance to change is their greatest challenge requiring a significant amount of time and effort. Sustaining momentum (keeping it fresh) across multiple units spanning the globe is more challenging."

**Implications:** Address change management capabilities; help VP CX drive organizational adoption.

---

### Finding: Authority Building is Critical to Success
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** CCO Council identifies three sources of CCO Authority: Positional Authority, Borrowed Authority, or both. "Without such authority, cultural resistance to change, conflicting priorities, and other obstacles prevent CCO success."

**Implications:** Help VP CX build internal credibility with data, proof points, and executive-level insights.

---

### Finding: Skill Gaps Exist in Critical Areas
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Deloitte Digital reports candidates "may lack some critical skills, including insight gathering, human-centered design, experience measurement, and strategic technology orchestration."

**Implications:** Tools that address these skill gaps have strong value proposition.

## Buying Behavior

### Budget Authority

- Final decision on CX platforms (Qualtrics, Medallia, InMoment)
- May share budget with CMO/COO depending on org structure
- Larger transformational initiatives may require CEO/CFO approval

### Evaluation Criteria

3. **Analytics & Insights** — Quality of customer intelligence
4. **Implementation Support** — Change management assistance

- 41% have preferred vendor before formal evaluation (Gartner)
- Complete 60%+ of buying process before engaging vendor
- Prefer vendors who understand their strategic mandate

## Messaging Strategy

### Problem Framing (What Resonates)
- "Your CX initiatives are disconnected from revenue metrics — how do you prove value to the CEO?"
- "Customer journey data lives in silos across marketing, sales, product, and support"
- "You're spending time fighting organizational resistance instead of improving customer experience"
- "Every department claims to own the customer, but no one has the unified view"

### Proof Points That Work
- ROI metrics expressed in dollars ("Delivered 300% ROI, turning $10K into $40K")
- Cross-functional success stories ("Unified CX data across 5 departments")
- Revenue impact ("Improved NRR from 95% to 115%")
- Change management wins ("Achieved 80% adoption across the organization")

### Effective CTAs
- "See how [similar company] connected CX to $X in revenue impact"
- "Here's the ROI framework we use with other CX leaders"
- "Worth a quick chat about your cross-functional CX challenges?"
- Specific date/time CTAs double meeting bookings (15% to 37%)

### Value Proposition Positioning
- Position as strategic partner, not vendor
- Emphasize cross-functional capabilities
- Lead with revenue impact, not satisfaction scores
- Address change management and adoption

## Anti-Patterns (What Kills Response Rates)

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|--------------|--------------|
| Treating VP CX like a support leader | They have cross-functional mandate; support is one piece |
| Focusing only on CSAT/NPS | They need revenue metrics, not just sentiment |
| Ignoring organizational change challenges | This is their biggest barrier |
| Generic "improve customer experience" messaging | Too vague; need specific business outcomes |
| Not understanding their authority dynamics | They may need to build credibility internally |
| Underestimating their strategic scope | They influence company-wide decisions |
| Pitching point solutions | They need integrated, cross-functional tools |
| Ignoring budget sensitivity | Budget constraints are #2 challenge |
