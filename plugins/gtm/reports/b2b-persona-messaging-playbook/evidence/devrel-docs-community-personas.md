## Universal Anti-Patterns for Developer-Adjacent Roles

1. **Generic templates** - all can spot mail-merge instantly
2. **Marketing fluff** - they value precision and technical substance
3. **Not researching their public work** - they have talks, blogs, social presence
4. **High-pressure CTAs** - calendar links in first email feel presumptuous
5. **AI over-promises** - skeptical given "almost right" experiences
6. **Treating them as marketing targets** - they identify as practitioners
