## Buying Behavior

### Budget Authority
- **Full authority** for support technology stack
- **Primary decision maker** for helpdesk, ticketing, chat tools
- **Shared authority** with CIO/IT for enterprise-wide platforms
- **Influence** on CX technology decisions that impact support

### Technology Stack Context
The global customer service software market is valued at $14.9 billion, projected to reach $68.19 billion by 2031 (20.94% CAGR).

**Major Categories:**
- Helpdesk/Ticketing (Zendesk, Freshdesk, Salesforce Service Cloud)
- Live Chat/Messaging (Intercom, Drift, Front)
- AI/Chatbots (Ada, Ultimate.ai, Forethought)
- Knowledge Base (Guru, Confluence, Notion)
- Quality Assurance (Klaus, MaestroQA)
- Workforce Management (Assembled, Tymeshift)

### Evaluation Criteria (Priority Order)
1. **Omnichannel capabilities** — Unified experience across channels
2. **AI-powered automation** — Deflection and efficiency gains
3. **Integration with existing tools** — CRM, helpdesk, knowledge base
4. **Scalability** — Can grow with team and volume
5. **Ease of implementation** — Time to value
6. **Value for money** — Total cost of ownership

### Decision Process
- 3-6 month evaluation cycles for major platforms

## Messaging Strategy

### Problem Framing (What Resonates)
- "Your support team is drowning in tickets while leadership asks for AI strategy"
- "You're managing 6+ tools that don't talk to each other"
- "Support is still seen as a cost center — how do you prove revenue impact?"
- "Your agents are burning out on repetitive questions AI could handle"
- "Customer expectations are rising but headcount is frozen"

### Proof Points That Work
- AI resolution rate improvements (X% of tickets resolved automatically)
- Cost reduction metrics ($X saved per month/year)
- CSAT/NPS improvements with before/after
- Time savings for agents (X hours/week recovered)
- Integration depth with their existing stack
- Customer case studies from similar-stage companies

### Effective CTAs
- "Here's how [similar company] automated 40% of Tier 1 tickets in 90 days"
- "Quick question about your AI strategy — worth 15 minutes?"
- "Free ROI calculator for support automation"
- "See the Zendesk/Intercom/[their tool] integration in action"

### Value Proposition Positioning
- Lead with AI automation and efficiency
- Connect to CSAT and customer satisfaction outcomes
- Emphasize integration, not replacement
- Show path to proving revenue impact
- Address team adoption and change management

---

## Anti-Patterns (What Kills Response Rates)

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|--------------|--------------|
| Treating support as "just a cost center" | They're working to be seen as value drivers |
| Overpromising AI capabilities | They've been burned by "AI" that doesn't work |
| Ignoring integration requirements | Adding another tool is a burden |
| Generic "improve support" messaging | Too vague; need specific outcomes |
| Focusing only on speed metrics | They're moving toward satisfaction and loyalty |
| Not understanding their tech stack | They want vendors who do homework |
| High-pressure demos | They need internal buy-in first |
| Ignoring agent experience | They care deeply about their teams |

## VP Support vs. VP Customer Success Distinction

| Dimension | VP Support | VP Customer Success |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Primary Focus** | Reactive issue resolution | Proactive relationship management |
| **Metrics** | CSAT, FCR, AHT, Resolution Time | NRR, Churn, Expansion, Health Score |
| **Team Structure** | Often larger, tiered (T1/T2/T3) | Smaller, account-based |
| **Engagement Model** | Transactional | Relationship-driven |
| **Revenue Tie** | Indirect (satisfaction → retention) | Direct (upsell, expansion) |
