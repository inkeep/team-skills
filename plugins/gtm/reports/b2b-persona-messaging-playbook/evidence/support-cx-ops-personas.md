## 8. Messaging Strategy

### Problem Framing (What Resonates)

1. **Data Fragmentation**
   - "Your support data lives in 5 different systems — how do you get a single source of truth?"
   - "Your team is juggling 6+ tools to manage CX — what if you could consolidate?"

2. **Manual Process Burden**
   - "Manual processes are eating up 20+ hours per week that could be automated"
   - "Integration gaps mean agents are copy-pasting between systems instead of helping customers"

3. **ROI Uncertainty**
   - "You've automated, but can you prove it's actually saving time or improving CSAT?"

4. **Scaling Challenges**
   - "Your processes worked at 10 agents — what breaks at 50?"

### Proof Points That Work

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Integration success | "Connected Zendesk + Salesforce + Slack in 2 weeks" |
| Time savings | "Reduced manual routing by 15 hours/week" |
| Implementation speed | "Live in 2 weeks, not 6 months" |
| TCO comparison | "43% lower TCO than [competitor]" |
| Data quality | "Improved data accuracy from 72% to 98%" |

### Effective CTAs

1. **Technical credibility first:**
   - "Here's our API documentation — take a look before we talk"
   - "See how this connects to your Zendesk/Salesforce"

2. **Proof-focused:**
   - "See how [similar company] automated X and saved Y hours/week"
   - Technical demo or sandbox access

3. **Low commitment:**
   - Integration architecture review offer
   - "Worth a 15-minute technical deep-dive?"

### Anti-Patterns (What Kills Responses)

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|--------------|--------------|
| Non-technical messaging | They dismiss immediately |
| Ignoring integration requirements | If you don't mention their stack, you're irrelevant |
| Overpromising implementation ease | They've been burned before |
| Not knowing their tech stack | Do your homework |
| Generic ROI claims | "Saves time" means nothing without numbers |
| Underestimating technical sophistication | They often know more than the sales rep |
| AI hype without substance | They're skeptical after seeing AI promises fail |
| Ignoring data migration complexity | A major hidden cost they're aware of |
| Selling when decision requires VP | Know the budget threshold |
| Marketing fluff | They value precision and technical accuracy |
