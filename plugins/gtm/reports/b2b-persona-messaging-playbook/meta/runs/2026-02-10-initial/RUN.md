# Run: 2026-02-10-initial

**Status:** Closed
**Purpose:** Initial research pass for B2B Persona Messaging Playbook
**Completed:** 2026-02-10

## Research Scope

**Primary Question:** What does each persona care about, and how should cold email messaging be tailored to resonate with them?

## Dimensions Covered

1. Role responsibilities — What they own, what success looks like
2. Key metrics/KPIs — What numbers they report on
3. Day-to-day activities — How they spend their time, tools they use
4. Pain points & priorities — What keeps them up at night
5. Buying behavior — How they evaluate vendors, purchase triggers
6. Content consumption — What they read, formats that resonate
7. Messaging angle — Problem framing, proof points, CTAs that work
8. Anti-patterns — What turns them off in cold outreach

## Output Files Created

### Evidence Files
- `evidence/founder-executive-personas.md`
- `evidence/product-leader-personas.md`
- `evidence/cx-support-personas.md`
- `evidence/devrel-docs-community-personas.md`
- `evidence/growth-ai-content-personas.md`

### Final Report
- `REPORT.md` — Comprehensive playbook with 18 archetypes covering 44 personas

## Key Findings

1. Interest-based CTAs achieve 30% response rate (2x direct booking)
2. Narrow targeting (1 person) yields 7.8% reply vs 3.8% for 10+ people
3. Budget authority varies dramatically by level — Directors have it, ICs influence
4. Developer-adjacent personas are skeptical and detect sales tactics instantly
5. ROI proof is the universal VP-level challenge

## Gaps Identified

- Regional variations in content consumption
- Industry-specific messaging (healthcare, fintech, enterprise)
- Company stage dynamics (seed vs. Series C)
