**Intent:** Initial
**Created:** 2026-02-06

## Purpose
Comprehensive research on B2B SaaS outbound email effectiveness techniques (2025+). Focus on real operator/founder evidence, quantitative data, and actionable specifics — not generic marketing blog posts from email tooling vendors.

## Scope

**In-scope:**
- Subject lines, hooks, body structure, CTAs, rhetorical devices
- Personalization/ABM techniques with real examples
- Sequence architecture (timing, cadence, variation between emails)
- Value proposition framing and problem articulation
- Psychological/persuasion techniques applied to cold email
- Anti-patterns and what kills replies
- Quantitative data (reply rates, open rates, conversion metrics)

**Out-of-scope (avoid drift):**
- Email deliverability infrastructure (DNS, DKIM, SPF, DMARC, warming)
- Tool/platform comparisons (Apollo, Instantly, Smartlead, etc.)
- List building / lead sourcing techniques
- Legal compliance (CAN-SPAM, GDPR)
- Cold calling or non-email channels (except where multi-channel data is relevant to email strategy)

| 6 | Value Proposition & Problem Framing | Deep | P0 | W2 |
| 7 | Rhetorical & Psychological Devices | Deep | P0 | W2 |
| 8 | Sequence Architecture | Deep | P0 | W5 |
| 9 | Email-over-Email Variation | Deep | P0 | W5 |
| 10 | Timing & Send Optimization | Moderate | P1 | W5 |
| 11 | Anti-Patterns & What Kills Replies | Moderate | P1 | W4 |

## Source Quality Rules

**Prioritize (T1/T2):**
- Named founders/operators sharing their own data (e.g., "we sent X emails and got Y% reply rate")
- Sales leaders with public track records (LinkedIn posts, podcasts, conference talks)
- Data-backed studies from Gong, Lavender, Woodpecker, etc. (original research, not blog rehashes)
- Books/frameworks from recognized experts (Predictable Revenue, BASHO, etc.)

**Deprioritize (T3/T4):**
- Generic "10 tips for cold email" posts from email tooling companies
- Undated or AI-generated content
- Posts without author attribution or data backing

**Recency:** 2024-2025+ strongly preferred. Older only if foundational and still validated.

## Worker Groupings

| Worker | Dimensions | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| W1 | 1 (Subject Lines), 2 (Opening Hooks) | Closely related; same sources cover both |
| W2 | 3 (Body Copy), 6 (Value Prop), 7 (Rhetorical Devices) | All about email body content & persuasion |
| W3 | 4 (Personalization & ABM) | Standalone deep dive — needs detailed examples |
| W4 | 5 (CTAs), 11 (Anti-Patterns) | What works at close + what kills replies |
| W5 | 8 (Sequence Architecture), 9 (Email Variation), 10 (Timing) | All about sequence strategy & cadence |
