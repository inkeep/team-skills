# Run: 2026-02-06-additive

**Status:** Closed
**Closed:** 2026-02-07
**Intent:** Additive
**Created:** 2026-02-06

## Purpose
Add 6 new dimensions to the existing B2B outbound email report. These extend the original research into adjacent areas: founder/early-stage outbound, reader psychology & contrarian angles, real email examples, reply-to-meeting conversion, warm/signal-based outbound, and the AI-native tooling stack.

## Scope

**In-scope (delta only):**
- Founder-led & early-stage outbound (no social proof, startup-specific dynamics)
- Reader psychology: attention grabbing, contrarian/negative hooks, provocative angles
- Real email teardowns & examples from practitioners (with reply rate data)
- Reply-to-meeting conversion (post-reply handling)
- Warm outbound / signal-based outbound (inbound signals changing strategy)
- AI-native outbound stack & operational workflow (2025)

**Out-of-scope (avoid drift):**
- Everything already covered in the initial run (subject lines, body copy, CTAs, personalization depth, sequence architecture, timing, anti-patterns)
- Email deliverability infrastructure
- Tool comparisons (features/pricing)
- List building / lead sourcing
- Legal compliance

## Delta Rubric

| # | Dimension | Depth | Priority | Worker |
|---|-----------|-------|----------|--------|
| 12 | Founder-Led & Early-Stage Outbound | Deep | P0 | W6 |
| 13 | Reader Psychology & Contrarian/Negative Angles | Deep | P0 | W7 |
| 14 | Real Email Teardowns & Examples | Deep | P0 | W8 |
| 15 | Reply-to-Meeting Conversion | Moderate | P1 | W9 |
| 16 | Warm Outbound / Signal-Based Outbound | Moderate | P1 | W9 |
| 17 | AI-Native Outbound Stack & Workflow (2025) | Moderate | P1 | W10 |

## Source Quality Rules
Same as initial run. Prioritize real operator/founder accounts, data-backed studies, named practitioners. Deprioritize generic tooling company blog posts.

## Worker Groupings

| Worker | Dimensions | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| W6 | 12 (Founder-Led & Early-Stage) | Standalone — unique dynamics for pre-PMF/early-stage |
| W7 | 13 (Reader Psychology & Contrarian Angles) | Deep psychological dive — attention, negativity bias, provocation |
| W8 | 14 (Real Email Teardowns & Examples) | Collection task — actual emails shared by practitioners |
| W9 | 15 (Reply-to-Meeting), 16 (Warm Outbound) | Post-reply conversion + signal-based strategy |
| W10 | 17 (AI-Native Stack & Workflow) | Operational/tooling — how to set up the 2025 outbound stack |
