# Run: 2026-02-07-vendor-insights

**Status:** Closed
**Intent:** Additive
**Created:** 2026-02-07

## Purpose
Research what modern outbound/sales engagement platform companies actually publish about "new age" email techniques — filtering for concrete, practical, data-driven insights and ignoring pure product marketing.

## Scope

**In-scope (delta only):**
- Concrete data-driven insights from vendor blogs, research reports, and benchmark studies
- "New age" techniques for breaking through in modern email: what's actually new vs repackaged
- Proprietary data these companies publish (they sit on billions of emails — what do they share?)
- Practitioner frameworks originating from these companies' teams
- Specific techniques, patterns, or anti-patterns backed by their platform data
- What their data scientists / content teams publish that goes beyond "use our product"

**Out-of-scope (avoid drift):**
- Product feature comparisons or pricing
- Generic "how to use [Product]" tutorials
- Content that's purely "our tool does X"
- Everything already covered in dimensions 1-25 unless the vendor adds NEW data or a new angle

**Filter rule:** For each finding, ask: "Would this insight be useful even if the reader never uses this company's product?" If yes, include. If no, skip.

## Delta Rubric
