# Run: 2026-02-07-outliers-verticals

**Status:** Closed
**Intent:** Additive
**Created:** 2026-02-07

## Purpose
Two new dimensions: (1) what the top 1% of cold email practitioners actually do differently — the "outside of distribution" behaviors that separate outliers from the average; (2) whether cold outbound differs meaningfully when selling SaaS-to-SaaS vs SaaS-to-traditional-industry (healthcare, finance, manufacturing, etc.).

## Scope

**In-scope (delta only):**
- Dimension 27: Specific behaviors, workflows, habits, and techniques of top-performing cold email practitioners — what they do that average reps don't. Named practitioners with documented results. Quantified performance gaps. The "mundane excellence" angle (is it one big thing or many small things?). Coaching/training data on what interventions produce the biggest lifts. Gong's data on top vs average rep behaviors. Outlier case studies with real numbers.
- Dimension 28: Concrete, data-backed differences in cold outbound effectiveness by vertical/industry. SaaS-to-SaaS vs SaaS-to-healthcare vs SaaS-to-finance vs SaaS-to-manufacturing. Reply rates, conversion rates, cycle length, messaging style, compliance constraints, decision-maker accessibility, channel preferences, buying committee structure. NOT generic "tailor your message" advice — only include if there's actual data showing a difference.

**Out-of-scope (avoid drift):**
- Everything already covered in dimensions 1-26
- Generic "top performer mindset" or motivational content
- Industry-specific product marketing
- Legal compliance deep dive (HIPAA, SOX, etc.) — mention only if it materially affects cold email tactics
- Tool comparisons

**Filter rule:** For each finding, ask: "Does this give a practitioner something specific they can DO differently tomorrow?" If yes, include. If no, skip.

## Delta Rubric

| # | Dimension | Depth | Priority | Worker |
|---|-----------|-------|----------|--------|
| 27 | What the Top 1% Actually Do Differently | Deep | P0 | W22 |
| 28 | SaaS-to-SaaS vs SaaS-to-Traditional Industry | Deep | P0 | W23 |

## Worker Groupings

| Worker | Dimensions | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| W22 | 27 (Top 1% behaviors) | Outlier analysis, practitioner deep dives |
| W23 | 28 (Vertical differences) | Industry-specific data, cross-vertical comparison |
