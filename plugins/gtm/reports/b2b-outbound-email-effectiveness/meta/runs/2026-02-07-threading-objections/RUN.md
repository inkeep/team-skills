# Run: 2026-02-07-threading-objections

**Status:** Closed
**Intent:** Additive
**Created:** 2026-02-07

## Purpose
Two new dimensions: (1) multi-threading persona-specific messaging — how to write role-specific emails to different personas within the same target account; (2) objection preemption in email copy — how to neutralize common objections inside the email before the prospect replies.

## Scope

**In-scope (delta only):**
- Dimension 33: Multi-Threading Persona Messaging — how to write different emails for CFO vs VP Engineering vs end-user vs champion at the same account. Role-specific pain points, language, proof points, CTA types. Sequencing across personas (who first? parallel or sequential?). Multi-threading win rate data by role combination. Account-based email strategy. What data shows about persona-specific open/reply rates. Named frameworks for multi-persona outreach. How to avoid the "same template to the org chart" anti-pattern (which we have data kills replies — contacts-per-company curve). Relationship to deal stage (early vs late multi-threading).
- Dimension 34: Objection Preemption in Email Copy — how to proactively address "we already have a vendor," "not the right time," "too expensive," "we're too small/big for this," "I'm not the right person" inside email body or subject line. Distinction from post-reply objection handling. Pre-framing techniques (Braun's "poke the bear," Voss's "no-oriented"). Data on whether addressing objections in-email lifts or hurts reply rates. The JOLT Effect applied to email (indecision vs status quo). Inoculation theory applied to sales messaging. Named frameworks. The "permission-based" objection preemption approach ("If timing isn't right, no worries — but..."). Relationship to offer design (dim 21) and displacement messaging (dim 22).

**Out-of-scope (avoid drift):**
- Generic multi-channel strategy (already in dim 8)
- LinkedIn messaging copy (flagged but not in this run)
- Post-reply objection handling (phone/meeting skills, not email)
- Deliverability/infrastructure (moved to ops report)
- Everything already in dimensions 1-32

**Filter rule:** For each finding, ask: "Does this give an AE a specific way to write or structure their email differently based on the target persona or anticipated objection?" If yes, include. If no, skip.

## Delta Rubric

| # | Dimension | Depth | Priority | Worker |
|---|-----------|-------|----------|--------|
| 33 | Multi-Threading Persona Messaging | Deep | P0 | W28 |
| 34 | Objection Preemption in Email Copy | Deep | P0 | W29 |

## Worker Groupings

| Worker | Dimensions | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| W28 | 33 (Multi-threading personas) | Account-based messaging, role-specific copy, sequencing across buying committee |
| W29 | 34 (Objection preemption) | In-email objection handling, inoculation, pre-framing techniques |

## Existing Coverage (what workers should NOT duplicate)

### Already covered:
- Multi-threading increases win rates 2.2x (dim 8, Outreach data)
- Dorsey "3 I's" framework: Info low, Insights mid, Influence high (dim 29)
- Contacts-per-company failure curve: 1 contact = 7.8%, 10+ = 3.8% (dim 18/failure modes)
- JOLT Effect: 56% indecision vs 44% status quo (dim 22)
- Displacement messaging: "Why Change > Why Now > Why Us" (dim 22)
- Unconsidered needs: 10%+ persuasion lift in acquisition (dim 22)
- Interest-based CTAs double positive replies vs meeting requests (dim 5)
- C-suite responds 3x more positively (16.76% vs 5.20%) — requires outcome-framed offers (dim 21)
- Braun's "poke the bear" PS line and no-oriented questions (dims 7, 13)
- Voss's labeling and no-oriented question techniques (dim 13)
- Coleman's 5x5x5 framework — 5 min research per prospect (dim 14)
- Loss aversion 2x: losses feel 2x as painful as equivalent gains (dim 7)
- "Hope all is well" +24% meetings vs "I never heard back" -14% (dim 29)

### What we NEED that's new:
- W28: Specific messaging frameworks by persona/role. How to write the CFO email vs the VP Eng email vs the end-user email. Sequencing order data. Role-specific proof points. What data exists on persona-specific reply rates. Named multi-persona campaigns with results.
- W29: In-email objection preemption techniques with data. Does addressing objections help or hurt? Inoculation theory applied to sales email. The "permission-based" approach. Pre-framing specific objections. Frameworks for which objection to preempt by deal stage/persona. Distinction between acknowledging risk vs creating doubt.
