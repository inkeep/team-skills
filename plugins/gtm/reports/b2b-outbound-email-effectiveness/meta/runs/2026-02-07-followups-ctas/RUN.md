# Run: 2026-02-07-followups-ctas

**Status:** Closed
**Intent:** Additive
**Created:** 2026-02-07

## Purpose
Two critical gaps in the report: (1) follow-up email messaging strategy — what to actually SAY in emails 2-7, how angles should progress, which follow-up types perform best at which position; (2) content marketing CTAs in cold outbound — systematic breakdown of content formats (video, case study, benchmark, tool, webinar, etc.) with performance data per type, stage-matching, and buyer-persona matching.

## Scope

**In-scope (delta only):**
- Dimension 29: Follow-Up Email Messaging Strategy — what to say in emails 2-7, angle progression patterns, which follow-up types (social proof, objection handling, case study, re-angle, pain agitation, breakup, value-add, humor) perform best at which position in the sequence. Data on re-engagement approaches. How the VALUE PROPOSITION and TONE should evolve touch-by-touch. Named practitioners with documented follow-up frameworks. Real examples of high-performing follow-up sequences with actual copy. The psychology of why certain follow-up approaches work (recency, commitment escalation, loss aversion). Multi-channel follow-up integration (email 1 → LinkedIn → email 2 pattern). What separates a "nurture" from a "nag." Response rate by follow-up position with actual data.
- Dimension 30: Content Marketing CTAs in Cold Outbound — performance data by content format (video vs case study vs benchmark report vs free tool vs webinar vs template vs ROI calculator vs blog post vs podcast vs audit vs demo environment). Which content CTA works at which stage of the sequence (touch 1 vs touch 3 vs touch 5). Buyer-persona matching (C-suite vs VP vs Director vs IC — which content formats each prefers). Conversion rates by offer type. The "content as Trojan horse" strategy. Gated vs ungated content performance in cold outbound specifically (not inbound). How to frame content offers so they don't feel like marketing spam. Named examples of companies using content CTAs effectively in cold sequences.

**Out-of-scope (avoid drift):**
- Everything already covered in dimensions 1-28
- Sequence cadence/timing (already in dim 5)
- General CTA phrasing (already in dim 4)
- Offer hierarchy theory (already in dim 21)
- Inbound content marketing strategy (this is about content used AS a CTA in cold outbound only)
- Tool comparisons

**Filter rule:** For each finding, ask: "Does this give a practitioner a specific follow-up message or content CTA they can deploy tomorrow?" If yes, include. If no, skip.

## Existing Coverage (what workers should NOT duplicate)

Workers MUST read this section to avoid rediscovering what we already have.

### Already covered in the report (do NOT re-research):
- Sequence structure: 4-7 email sweet spot, Day 1/3/7/14/21 cadence (dim 5)
- Jed Mahrle Value Email + Context Email framework — 4-email structure (dim 5)
- Becc Holland wave framework — 21-day themed clusters (dim 5)
- Thread strategy: reply-to-own vs new thread hybrid (dim 5)
- Breakup email psychology (dim 5)
- 4th follow-up = 55% reply drop + 20x unsubscribe spike (dim 18)
- Interest-based CTAs 2x meeting-request (Gong 304K) (dim 4)
- Single CTA +371% vs multiple (dim 4)
- Three-tier offer hierarchy: Blind Date / 1:Many / 1:1 (dim 21)
- Loom video: 2-3x lift, under 60 seconds (dim 21)
- Audit offers: 4x vs PDF but trust spectrum (dim 21)
- Generic whitepapers = NOT genuine value (dim 21)
- Compelling offers +28% reply rate (dim 4)

### What we NEED that's new:
- W24: The actual MESSAGE CONTENT strategy per touch position. What angle/frame/value-prop works best at position 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. How to rotate angles without repeating. Real follow-up email copy examples with performance data. Psychology of follow-up persistence vs annoyance. Multi-channel follow-up sequencing (email+LinkedIn+call interleaving). Named practitioner follow-up frameworks beyond Mahrle/Holland.
- W25: Systematic performance comparison of content format types as cold email CTAs. Stage-matching data (which content at which touch). Persona-matching data (C-suite vs VP vs IC preferences). Gated vs ungated in cold context. How top practitioners frame content offers. Named examples/case studies. The "content as value exchange" vs "content as lead magnet" distinction in outbound.
