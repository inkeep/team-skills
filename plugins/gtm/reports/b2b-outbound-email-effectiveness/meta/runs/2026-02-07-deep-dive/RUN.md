# Run: 2026-02-07-deep-dive

**Status:** Closed
**Intent:** Additive
**Created:** 2026-02-07

## Purpose
Deep dive on 5 new dimensions: AI sentence-level tells & de-AI editing, the personalization line (helpful vs creepy), offer design, competitive displacement messaging, and cold email unit economics vs other channels.

## Scope

**In-scope (delta only):**
- AI writing tells at sentence/paragraph level — structural patterns, model-specific fingerprints, editing checklists, speed-vs-quality tradeoff
- The personalization spectrum — specific elements ranked by recipient response, plausible knowledge test, seniority/industry variation, practitioner calibration frameworks
- Offer design — what makes someone actually want to respond, audit/teardown offers, benchmark/content offers, value exchange frameworks
- Competitive displacement — how to unseat an incumbent when 92% already have a vendor, displacement messaging, "why switch" angles
- Cold email unit economics — cost-per-meeting, cost-per-opportunity, channel comparison (email vs LinkedIn vs events vs content vs warm intro vs paid)

**Out-of-scope (avoid drift):**
- Everything already covered in dimensions 1-18
- Deliverability infrastructure
- Tool comparisons (features/pricing)
- List building / lead sourcing
- Legal compliance

## Delta Rubric

| # | Dimension | Depth | Priority | Worker |
|---|-----------|-------|----------|--------|
| 19 | AI Writing Tells: Sentence-Level Patterns & De-AI Editing | Deep | P0 | W14 |
| 20 | The Personalization Line: Where Helpful Becomes Creepy | Deep | P0 | W15 |
| 21 | The Offer: What Makes Someone Actually Want to Respond | Deep | P0 | W16 |
| 22 | Competitive Displacement: How to Unseat an Incumbent | Moderate | P1 | W17 |
| 23 | Cold Email Unit Economics & Channel Comparison | Moderate | P1 | W17 |

## Source Quality Rules
Same as prior runs. Prioritize real operator/founder accounts, data-backed studies, named practitioners. Deprioritize generic tooling company blog posts. Buyer-side evidence especially valuable for personalization line research.

## Worker Groupings

| Worker | Dimensions | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| W14 | 19 (AI Sentence-Level Tells & De-AI Editing) | Deep linguistic/stylistic analysis |
| W15 | 20 (Personalization Line) | Buyer psychology + practitioner calibration |
| W16 | 21 (Offer Design) | Standalone value exchange research |
| W17 | 22 (Displacement) + 23 (Economics) | Related strategic dimensions |
