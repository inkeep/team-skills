# Run: 2026-02-07-halo-prompts

**Status:** Closed
**Intent:** Additive
**Created:** 2026-02-07

## Purpose
Two new dimensions: prompt engineering for cold email (how to get better AI first drafts) and the brand halo effect (what makes cold email not-cold).

## Scope

**In-scope (delta only):**
- Prompt engineering for cold email — prompt structure patterns, context-loading techniques (voice samples, brand guides, customer transcripts), voice cloning approaches, model selection, constraint-based prompting, few-shot examples, practical templates practitioners use, the "context engineering > prompt engineering" insight
- The brand halo effect — how LinkedIn presence/podcast/community/content activity affects cold email response rates, "seen your name before" effect, dark social, brand-aware vs brand-unaware prospect data, personal brand vs company brand, multi-channel familiarity before the email, quantified data on pre-warmed vs cold outbound

**Out-of-scope (avoid drift):**
- Everything already covered in dimensions 1-23
- Deliverability infrastructure
- Tool comparisons (features/pricing)
- List building / lead sourcing
- Legal compliance
- De-AI editing (covered in dimension 19)
- AI detection tells (covered in dimensions 18-19)
- Warm outbound / signal-based triggers (covered in dimension 16 — focus here is on BRAND recognition, not intent signals)

## Delta Rubric

| # | Dimension | Depth | Priority | Worker |
|---|-----------|-------|----------|--------|
| 24 | Prompt Engineering for Cold Email | Deep | P0 | W18 |
| 25 | The Brand Halo Effect: What Makes Cold Email Not-Cold | Deep | P0 | W19 |

## Source Quality Rules
Same as prior runs. Prioritize real operator/founder accounts, data-backed studies, named practitioners. For prompt engineering: actual prompt templates and before/after results > theoretical advice. For brand halo: quantified data on branded vs unbranded outbound performance, practitioner case studies with numbers.

## Worker Groupings

| Worker | Dimensions | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| W18 | 24 (Prompt Engineering) | Technical AI usage patterns |
| W19 | 25 (Brand Halo Effect) | GTM strategy / multi-channel |
