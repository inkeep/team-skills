## Findings

### Finding: Sweet spot for cold email sequences is 4-7 emails
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Woodpecker (20M emails), Instantly 2026, Belkins 2025, Lemlist — accessed 2026-02-06

- Woodpecker: 1-3 emails = 9% reply rate; 4-7 emails = 27% (3x improvement).
- Instantly: 58% of replies on Step 1; Steps 2-4 contribute remaining 42%. Recommended: 4-7 emails.
- Belkins: Per-email reply rate drops 55% by follow-up #4. Unsubscribe rates triple at 4th follow-up.
- Lemlist: Cumulative reply grows from 4.5% (1 email) to 22.37% (10 emails), but spam risk rises past 9.

**Implications:** 4-5 emails default. First follow-up is most impactful (+40% reply rate vs initial). Beyond 7 risks deliverability.

### Finding: Day 1/3/7/14/21 cadence is the emerging consensus spacing pattern
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** SalesBread, Martal Group, Instantly — accessed 2026-02-06

- Day 1: Initial > Day 3: Follow-up #1 > Day 7: #2 > Day 14: #3 > Day 21: Breakup/final.
- "3-7-7" variant (Day 0/3/10/17) reportedly captures 93% of total replies by day 10.
- Following up next day = 11% fewer responses vs waiting 2-3 days.

**Implications:** Minimum 2-3 business day gap for first follow-up. Progressively increase spacing. Total: 21-30 days.

---

### Finding: Multi-channel sequences (email + LinkedIn + phone) dramatically outperform email-only
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Closely HQ, Sopro 2025, Jason Bay, Gong — accessed 2026-02-06

- Closely HQ: LinkedIn + email = 3x higher conversion rates. Response rates up 40%.
- Sopro 2025: Email-only campaigns generating 30% fewer leads YoY.
- Gong: Leaving voicemails increases email reply rate from 2.73% to 5.87% (doubles).
- Multi-channel: 4.7x higher prospect engagement vs single-channel.
- Jason Bay KISS: 6 calls, 6 emails, 3 social over 3 weeks.

**Implications:** Pure email-only declining. Add LinkedIn touches + phone calls. Phone after 1-2 emails (Day 3-5) doubles email reply rates via voicemail.

---

### Finding: Multi-threading (multiple contacts per company) increases win rates up to 6x
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Outreach (billions of interactions), Aviso, pclub.io — accessed 2026-02-06

- Single-threaded: ~5% win rate. Multi-threaded (5+ contacts): ~30% (6x improvement).
- Cross-department: 1 dept = 28%, 2 depts = 39%, 3+ depts = 44%.
- Larger deals (>$50K): Multi-threading closes 22% faster.
- Number of departments > number of contacts within a single department.

**Implications:** For enterprise/mid-market, multi-threading is table stakes. Thread across departments. Coordinate different angles per persona.

### Finding: Jed Mahrle's "Value Email + Context Email" framework provides practical 4-email structure
**Confidence:** INFERRED
**Evidence:** Jed Mahrle, Practical Prospecting (Post #86) — accessed 2026-02-06

- VALUE EMAIL: Full email, new thread — signal, pain point, value prop, CTA.
- CONTEXT EMAIL: Reply in same thread, shorter — adds supporting context, no hard CTA, gives original email another chance.
- Sequence: Day 1 Value #1 (Signal/Pain #1) > Day 3 Context #1 > Day 7 Value #2 (Signal/Pain #2) > Day 10 Context #2.

**Implications:** Solves "what do I say in emails 2/3/4." Alternate between substantial value emails (new thread) and shorter context bumps (same thread). Each value email uses different signal/pain = angle rotation.

---

### Finding: Breakup email generates replies but not necessarily meetings
**Confidence:** INFERRED
**Evidence:** Gong, Belkins 2025 — accessed 2026-02-06

- Gong: "Never heard back" = -14% meetings. "Thoughts?" = -20% meetings (despite raising reply rate).
- Breakup emails often generate polite declines, not meeting-ready responses.
- Better alternative: Final email introduces completely new angle or value.

**Implications:** Don't rely on guilt-based breakup emails. Frame final email as value-forward (share resource/insight) rather than guilt-forward.

---

### Finding: Reply-to-own-thread works for first 1-2 follow-ups; new threads better for later touches
**Confidence:** INFERRED
**Evidence:** Bravado community, MagicEmails, Jed Mahrle framework — accessed 2026-02-06

- Threading benefits: Visual reminder, bumps to inbox top. "Bump" reply emails get highest response rates.
- After 2 replies in same thread: diminishing returns. Recipient assumes already dealt with.
- Hybrid approach: Thread first 1-2 follow-ups, new thread with fresh subject for email 3+.
- Mahrle pattern: Value Email (new thread) > Context Email (same thread) > Value Email (new thread) > Context (same thread).

**Implications:** Thread first follow-up (Day 3). Fresh thread for email 3+ gives second chance at opens.

### Finding: Becc Holland's "wave" framework structures sequences by themed clusters
**Confidence:** INFERRED
**Evidence:** Becc Holland (Flip the Script), GTMnow, SellBetter — accessed 2026-02-06

- 21-day framework: Touches organized into waves of 3-4 touches.
- Wave 1: Connection/right person. Wave 2: Case study/social proof. Wave 3: Different value angle.
- 4 touches Day 1-2, then 3 touches every other day. Breakup email if no response.
- Each wave = new reason to respond, not reminder of same pitch.

**Implications:** Thematic waves prevent 5 emails that all say the same thing. Wave 1 lightest, Wave 2 adds proof, Wave 3 changes angle entirely.

### Finding: Tuesday-Thursday, 6-11 AM in recipient's timezone is optimal send window
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Salesforge, Lemlist (2024), Siege Media (85K emails), Smartlead, Martal — accessed 2026-02-06

- Salesforge: Tuesday = 20% higher open rates.
- Lemlist: 5-8 AM = 25% higher reply rates.
- Siege Media (85K emails): 6-9 AM optimal for replies.
- Zeliq: Thursday mornings 9-11 AM = 44.0% open rate.
- Consensus: Tuesday-Thursday, morning (6-11 AM), recipient's local timezone.
- Avoid: Monday (overload), Friday PM (wind-down), Saturday (worst).
- 75% of emails opened within first hour.

**Implications:** Send 6-11 AM in recipient's timezone, Tue-Thu. Timezone segmentation = 14-20% higher engagement.

---

### Finding: "Tuesday 10am" convergence is real — randomized sends and off-peak windows gaining traction
**Confidence:** INFERRED
**Evidence:** Salesforge, Mailreach, Woodpecker — accessed 2026-02-06

- Problem: Everyone reading same "best time" data converges, creating peak inbox competition.
- Solutions: Randomized send times (mimic human behavior), spread across 2-4 hour window, consistent daily volumes.
- Max 100 cold emails/day per sending address (Mailreach).
- Erratic volume (500 Mon, 0 Tue, 1000 Fri) kills deliverability.

**Implications:** Spread across morning window with randomized delays. Consistent daily volume matters more than perfect micro-time.

---

### Finding: Video/Loom in later emails can boost reply rates 2-3x, but only if personalized and under 60 seconds
**Confidence:** INFERRED
**Evidence:** Loom/Intercom case study, ListKit, Martal — accessed 2026-02-06

- Intercom: Reply rates jumped 19% with Loom. $120K from Loom-enhanced outbound.
- General: Personalized Loom = 2-3x response rates. Only effective if under 60 seconds, genuinely personalized (showing prospect's site/LinkedIn), and placed in email 3+.

**Implications:** Loom is differentiation play for email 3+. Must be visibly personalized. Thumbnail and first 5 seconds determine click.

---

### Finding: Re-enrollment should be 60-90 days with completely fresh angle
**Confidence:** INFERRED
**Evidence:** Martal Group, Pipeline CRM, practitioner consensus — accessed 2026-02-06

- 60% of customers say "no" four times before "yes."
- Enterprise: 60-90 day cooldown. SMB: 60 day cooldown.
- Must use different sequence entirely — new angle, signal, pain point.
- Signal-based re-enrollment strongest (job change, funding, new event).

**Implications:** Systematic recycling process. Re-enrollment triggered by new signals. Same emails = spam.

---

### Finding: Seasonal patterns — Q4 volume surges 40-60%
**Confidence:** INFERRED
**Evidence:** Mailpool seasonal analysis — accessed 2026-02-06

- Q4: 40-60% volume increase (year-end budget chase). Increased competition.
- Q1: Slow start (budget approvals). Seeds from November convert in January.
- Key: Segment by fiscal year. March fiscal year-end ≠ December budget urgency.

**Implications:** Know target accounts' fiscal calendars. Time budget-focused outreach to actual decision cycles.

---

### Finding: Volume consistency and engagement quality matter more than perfect send time
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Mailreach, Instantly, GetResponse — accessed 2026-02-06

- GetResponse: Business hours = 23% higher opens, 2x better CTR vs overnight.
- Consistent sending = +15-20% higher replies.
- Engagement quality (time reading, reply depth) now weighted more heavily by providers.
- Max 100 cold emails/day per address.

**Implications:** Deliverability is hidden foundation. Consistent daily volumes + quality engagement protect sender reputation.

## Negative searches

- "Lavender email timing data send time" — Lavender focuses on content quality, not timing.
- Specific A/B test Day 1/3/7/14/21 vs Day 1/4/9/14 — No head-to-head found.
- Per-step reply rate granular curve — Instantly gives 58% Step 1, but not step-by-step breakdown.

---

## Gaps / follow-ups

- Per-step reply rate decay curve from large dataset
- Reply-to-thread vs new-thread controlled A/B experiment
- Industry-specific cadence optimization (manufacturing vs SaaS vs healthcare)
- Video/Loom placement optimization (which step produces highest lift)
- Multi-threading at cold outbound stage (vs warm deal stage)
