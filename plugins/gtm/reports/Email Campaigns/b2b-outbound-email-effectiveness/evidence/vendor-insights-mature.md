## Company-by-Company Findings

### Outreach

**What they publish that's actually useful:**

Outreach's 2025 Sales Data Report draws from both market survey data and platform analytics (930K sequences launched, 29M prospects contacted, 43.9M deals processed). Key practitioner-relevant findings:

1. **Win rate compression is real and measurable.** The majority of sales organizations now report win rates of 16-30%, down from 2024 when 27% of teams achieved 31-40% rates. Only 13% of teams reach the 40%+ tier. The overall market average win rate is 21%.

2. **Speed-to-close is the dominant predictor of deal success.** Deals closed within 50 days show a 47% win rate (among Outreach users); deals extending beyond 50 days drop to 20% or lower. 34% of revenue teams report average cycles of 1-2 full quarters. Deals that include live meetings close 32 days faster for opportunities above $10K.

3. **The 3-email maximum rule for email-only outreach.** Outreach's own cadence data explicitly recommends limiting email-only outreach to three attempts before switching channels. This directly contradicts the "8-12 email sequence" advice that many in the industry still follow. B2B sales require an average of 8 touchpoints, but those must span multiple channels, not email alone. Initial contact typically requires 5-7 touches.

4. **AI-SDR hybrid model is the current sweet spot.** 45% of teams use a hybrid AI-SDR model, 22% have fully replaced SDRs with AI, 23% don't use AI. 100% of AI-SDR users report saving 1+ hours per week; 38% save 4-7 hours; 35% save 8-12 hours. AI tools cut research and personalization time by 90%. A majority (52%) of teams report AI has driven a 10-25% increase in pipeline.

5. **Send-time optimization matters more than expected.** Predicting optimal send times on a per-recipient basis can improve open rates by 35-50% compared to batch sending. Tuesday and Thursday show highest B2B open rates. Afternoons outperform mornings for reply rates.

6. **Personalization has a measurable ceiling.** Customized templates produce 10% higher open rates and 2x reply rates vs. standard templates. However, these are platform-wide averages -- the delta between top and average performers is much wider.

7. **Lead qualification has overtaken opportunity management as the #1 seller challenge** (24% vs. 23%), marking a notable shift from the prior year.

**What's just product marketing (skip detail):**
Heavy emphasis on Outreach's AI agents (Research Agent, etc.) as the solution to personalization challenges. Kaia coaching assistant impact data (+10 percentage points win rate, 11 days faster) is platform-specific. The 47% win rate benchmark is inflated by platform selection bias (teams that adopt Outreach may already be higher-performing).

**Bias flag:** Outreach's 3-email-max recommendation could be self-serving -- it nudges users toward their multi-channel sequence builder rather than email-only tools. But the underlying data point (diminishing returns after 3 email-only touches) is corroborated by Gong and others.

### Salesloft (now merged with Clari)

**What they publish that's actually useful:**

Salesloft's 2025 State of Pipeline Generation report, based on 100+ sales professionals, plus their 2025 Sales Skills Gap Survey:

1. **86.1% of sellers report higher pipeline quotas than last year, while 39.6% say their current pipeline is weaker.** This quota-pipeline gap is the central tension in outbound right now -- teams are being asked to do more with less effective channels.

2. **55.4% of sellers say the top barrier is buyer reluctance to engage with sales reps.** This is the single most important data point for outbound practitioners: more than half of sellers report that buyers simply do not want to talk to them. This validates the shift toward signal-based and value-first outreach.

3. **76.2% prioritize enhancing personalization and relevance in outreach.** Nearly every seller knows personalization matters; the gap is execution, not awareness.

4. **46.5% identify excessive manual work as a significant constraint.** The "first mile" of sales -- initial prospect research through personalized messaging -- contains the greatest operational inefficiencies.

5. **Only 20% of sellers use buyer signals to guide prioritization.** 43% rely on personal judgment and 25% on customer demographics. This is a damning statistic: four out of five sellers are not using signal-based prioritization despite the entire industry talking about it.

6. **55% of sellers lack access to AI tools; 53% say they need more time and training.** AI adoption in practice lags far behind AI availability.

**Post-merger context (Clari + Salesloft, completed December 2025):**

The combined Clari + Salesloft entity now manages $10 trillion in annual customer revenue, ingests 10 billion+ revenue interactions and 1 trillion data signals. Clari Labs research found 87% of enterprises missed 2025 revenue targets despite record AI investment. 48% say their revenue data is not AI-ready. 55% report conflicting pipeline signals from disconnected data sources. 57% say AI agents have not been fully deployed across revenue operations.

**What's just product marketing (skip detail):**
The Forrester TEI study ($75M pipeline generation, 3.3x ROI) is a commissioned study for a composite organization. The 26 AI agents across the revenue cycle are product features. The "25% increase in meetings booked weekly" case study is a single customer.

**Bias flag:** Salesloft's pipeline generation data comes from a small sample (100+ sellers) and may skew toward their user base. The merger with Clari positions them to tell a "unified revenue intelligence" story that validates their combined product.

### Gong

**What they publish that's actually useful:**

Gong has the most extensive and practitioner-relevant published research of any company studied, drawing from analysis of 28M-85M+ cold emails (partnership with 30MPC), 300M+ cold calls, 304K emails for CTA analysis, and 30K+ emails from 250+ companies for personalization analysis. Key findings:

**Cold Email Effectiveness (Overall):**

1. **The average rep sends 344 cold emails to land one meeting.** Top performers book 8.1x more meetings (23 vs. 3 per period). Top reps achieve 4.2x higher reply rates and 2.1x higher open rates than average reps. The performance gap between top and average is the single biggest variable in cold email -- not the channel itself.

2. **Pitching in cold emails reduces reply rates by up to 57%.** This is one of the most consequential findings: the instinct to describe your product in a cold email actively destroys response rates. ROI language decreases success rates by 15%. Asking for "thoughts" decreases meetings booked by 20% (it increases replies but they don't convert). Guilt-inducing phrases like "I never heard back" decrease meetings booked by 14%.

3. **Buzzwords and numbers in subject lines reduce open rates by up to 17.9%.** Subject lines should be 4 words or fewer, lowercase, and resemble internal messages (e.g., "trial delays", "hiring ops", "2024 forecasts"). Priority-based language outperforms sales language.

4. **"Hope all is well" as an opener increases meetings booked by 24%.** This directly contradicts the "don't waste words on pleasantries" advice common in outbound coaching. Nicety openings build trust.

**Email Length (Nuanced):**

5. **Initial cold emails: under 100 words (3-4 sentences) produce highest reply rates.** But follow-up emails with 4+ sentences book 15x more meetings than follow-ups with 3 or fewer sentences. The rule is: short to get in the door, longer to provide value once engaged.

**CTA Strategy (304K emails analyzed):**

6. **Interest-based CTAs are 2x more effective than specific or open-ended CTAs for cold emails.** Interest CTAs convert at 30% vs. 15% (specific) and 13% (open-ended). The principle: "sell the conversation, not the meeting." However, once in a deal, specific CTAs suggesting a day/time more than double meetings booked (from 15% to 37%). CTA strategy must change by stage.

**Personalization by Buyer Level (30K+ emails, 250+ companies):**

7. **Personalization effectiveness varies dramatically by seniority.** One-to-one individual personalization doubles reply rates for non-managerial personas but shows only 50% lift for directors+. Company-specific topic personalization triples reply rates for executives but has little impact on lower-level buyers. Activity-based personalization (referencing prior engagement, content downloads, event attendance) generates 3x increase in both replies AND meetings. Industry-based personalization correlates with 88% increase in reply rates.

**Multi-Channel Data:**

8. **Cold calling nearly doubles email reply rates (3.44% vs. 1.81%), even when no live connection occurs.** Leaving voicemails increases email reply rates from 2.73% to 5.87%. Initiating prospecting with a cold call can double the email reply rate within the flow. Top cold callers: 13.3% connect rate vs. 5.4% average, converting 16.7% of conversations to meetings vs. 4.6% average.

**AI and Revenue:**

9. **Sellers frequently using AI generate 77% more revenue** (from analysis of 7.1M opportunities). AI went from "time-saver to revenue driver" in 2025.

**Deal-Level Insights:**

10. **Multi-threading boosts win rates by 130% in deals over $50K.** Successful deals have 2x as many buyer contacts as failed ones. Enterprise deals average 17 contacts. 77% of deals involve multiple contacts. Closed-won deals involve 67% larger selling teams. Sales engineer involvement increases win rates by up to 30%.

**What's just product marketing (skip detail):**
Gong Engage platform analytics, AI coaching features, and "Smart Trackers" are product-specific. Their "2,300 distinct classifiers" methodology is proprietary tech.

**Bias flag:** Gong's dataset skews toward companies large enough to afford Gong (typically mid-market to enterprise). Their 85M email analysis with 30MPC is genuinely large-scale but the 30MPC audience skews toward high-growth B2B SaaS. Gong has incentive to publish data showing cold outreach "still works" because their product helps optimize it. However, their willingness to publish negative findings (pitching destroys reply rates, guilt-tripping hurts) adds credibility.

---

### ZoomInfo

**What they publish that's actually useful:**

ZoomInfo's published research is more product-centric than the other companies studied, but their signal-based selling data is practitioner-relevant:

1. **Early ZoomInfo Copilot users report 58% increase in engagement, 62% increase in email response rates, and nearly 25% more pipeline.** These are self-reported early-adopter numbers, so they should be discounted, but the directional signal is clear: signal-based targeting produces meaningfully better results than cold outreach to static lists.

2. **"Guided Intent" concept:** ZoomInfo's system analyzes CRM opportunity data to identify which intent signals correlate with closed-won deals, then targets prospects exhibiting those specific signals. The platform-agnostic insight: working backward from closed-won deal patterns to identify which buying signals actually predict revenue is more valuable than raw intent volume.

3. **Person-level website visitor identification (WebSight Buyer ID):** ZoomInfo can now identify individual decision-makers visiting your website, not just company-level traffic. The practitioner insight: the window between "anonymous researcher" and "identified prospect" is closing, and the companies that can act on website visitor identity data in real-time have a structural advantage.

**What's just product marketing (skip detail):**
Most ZoomInfo content is thinly-veiled product marketing for Copilot, intent data features, and their contact database. The "400M+ contacts and 100M+ companies" positioning is product capability, not insight.

**Bias flag:** ZoomInfo's core business is selling contact data, so they have a structural incentive to position their data as essential and to avoid publishing findings that suggest "less outreach to better-targeted prospects" (which would reduce the perceived value of a massive contact database). The 58%/62%/25% improvement numbers are from early adopters who are likely already sophisticated practitioners.

---

### 6sense

**What they publish that's actually useful:**

6sense publishes the most methodologically rigorous buyer behavior research of any company studied. Their 2025 Buyer Experience Report surveyed 4,000+ buyers across NA, EMEA, and APAC, with a supplementary survey of 766 additional respondents focused on AI and economic uncertainty impacts.

1. **Buyers purchase from their Day One shortlist 95% of the time (up from 85% in 2024).** The winning vendor after the Selection phase wins roughly 7 in 10 deals. 94% of buying groups ranked their preferred vendors before making first contact with any vendor. This is the most important strategic finding for outbound: by the time your cold email arrives, the buyer has almost certainly already decided their shortlist. Cold outbound that attempts to "get on the shortlist" for an active buying cycle is almost always too late.

2. **Buying cycle compressed from 11.3 months (2024) to 10.1 months (2025).** First contact shifted from 69% of the journey to 61% -- roughly 6-7 weeks earlier. But this is not "sellers getting in earlier" -- it's buyers reaching out earlier to validate their already-formed preferences. Buyers still initiate 80% of first contacts.

3. **Average buying group is 10+ members (on $250K+ average deal size).** Buyers average 8-9 previous purchases in their category. By the time the shortlist is filled, the average buying group member knows 75% of vendors on it (up from 69% prior year). With groups evaluating 5.1 vendors on average, roughly one spot is open for a vendor the buying group has no prior experience with.

4. **97% of buyer research is anonymous.** Only 3% of website visitors self-identify through form fills. Despite all the talk of "intent data," the vast majority of the buyer journey is invisible to sellers.

5. **AI features are now in 89% of B2B purchases.** But LLMs are used primarily for synthesizing and organizing research (94% use them to summarize reviews or analyze data). Buyers still averaged 16 interactions per person with the winning vendor -- unchanged from last year. AI has not reduced the number of touchpoints needed; it has changed what happens during them.

6. **44% of EMEA buyers engage vendors earlier specifically to clarify AI implementation details.** This is a net-new buying behavior: AI uncertainty is pulling forward vendor engagement, but for validation, not discovery.

**What's just product marketing (skip detail):**
The "1 trillion buyer signals per day" claim is product positioning. The "only 10% of companies are in-market at any time" statistic validates their intent data product. AI Agents for email are product features.

**Bias flag:** 6sense has the strongest structural incentive of any company studied to publish data showing that "cold outreach to unknown accounts is futile" because their product is designed to identify which accounts are in-market. Their Day One Shortlist finding is the most important data point in this entire evidence file, but it serves their sales narrative perfectly. That said, the 4,000+ buyer survey methodology is credible, and the findings are consistent year-over-year and across geographies, which adds confidence.

### HubSpot

**What they publish that's actually useful:**

HubSpot's 2025 State of Sales Report surveyed 1,000 global sales professionals:

1. **Social outreach now outranks email for response rates (42% vs. 26%).** 35% of reps say their highest-quality leads come from social channels. 45% rate social media "very effective" for driving sales. This is arguably the most underappreciated finding for email-focused outbound practitioners: the channel that produces the best response rates is social, not email.

2. **92% of reps now use AI tools.** 37% use AI more than any other tool category. 31% rate AI as their highest-ROI tool. 84% say AI saves time; 83% say it personalizes prospect interactions; 82% say it surfaces better data insights. 78% of sales reps want AI assistance specifically for personalizing outreach.

3. **40% say free tools convert best for lead generation.** This is a significant finding for the product-led / outbound convergence question: offering a free tool or resource is the top-performing lead generation mechanism -- ahead of gated content, webinars, and cold outreach.

4. **Deal-killers: 37% cite no product fit; 35% cite poor value-for-money.** The top upsell driver is understanding customer goals (42%), followed by providing consistent value (39%) and establishing trust and rapport (40%).

5. **74% of sales pros believe AI makes buyer research easier.** But the seller's primary role is shifting: 36% say it's helping buyers feel confident; 33% say it's navigating internal buy-in.

6. **Sales professionals spend about 21% of their day writing emails.** Personalized subject lines are 50% more likely to be opened (consistent with Gong data but a lower bar -- this is subject line personalization, not body personalization).

**What's just product marketing (skip detail):**
HubSpot Breeze AI Agents, Prospecting Agent features, and Sales Hub capabilities. The "129% more leads, 36% more closed deals" stat is platform-specific.

**Bias flag:** HubSpot's audience skews SMB/mid-market, so their "42% social response rate" may not hold for enterprise deals where email still dominates. Their free-tool-as-lead-gen finding is convenient given HubSpot's own freemium GTM motion. The 1,000-respondent survey methodology is solid but represents a broad mix of sophistication levels.

---

### Clari

**What they publish that's actually useful:**

Clari Labs surveyed 400 CIOs, CROs, and RevOps leaders at North American enterprises (1,000+ employees):

1. **87% of enterprises missed 2025 revenue targets despite record AI investment.** This is the headline finding -- AI spending is not translating to revenue performance for the vast majority of enterprises.

2. **48% say their revenue data is not AI-ready.** 42% lack formal data governance frameworks. 55% report conflicting pipeline signals from disconnected data sources. 57% say AI agents have not been fully deployed across revenue operations.

3. **64% of revenue leaders say CIO teams now lead selection and implementation of forecasting and revenue tools.** This is a meaningful shift -- revenue tool decisions are moving from sales/RevOps leadership to IT leadership, which changes who outbound vendors need to sell to.

**What's just product marketing (skip detail):**
"Predictive Revenue System" positioning, $96.2M in customer value claim, Clari Revenue AI dataset positioning.

**Bias flag:** Clari's "87% missed targets" finding creates urgency for their product category. The survey sample (400 enterprise leaders) is reasonable but exclusively North American enterprises 1,000+ employees -- findings may not apply to mid-market or SMB.

---

### Vidyard

**What they publish that's actually useful:**

Vidyard publishes the most specific video email performance data:

1. **Video email performance lifts (aggregated across case studies):** Open rates increase 22-68% with video (e.g., 1Huddle: 68% open rate; Terminus: 40% higher open rate; ReviewTrackers: 22% higher open rate). Click-through rates increase 4-8x (Superside: 2.5% CTR without video to 17% CTR with video). Reply rates improve 4-216% (Superside: 1.5% to 6%; Terminus: 216% higher; ReviewTrackers: 92% higher; 1Huddle: 12% reply rate).

2. **People are 13% more likely to remember details from video emails vs. text.** This matters for complex products where comprehension, not just attention, drives conversion.

3. **Video creation is accelerating across industries.** Education +436%, consulting +280%, professional services +200%, financial services +189%, high tech +149%.

**What's just product marketing (skip detail):**
Vidyard's AI video features, pricing, and platform capabilities. The "$100K more in revenue from automating videos" case study is company-specific.

**Bias flag:** The performance lift numbers come from individual case studies, not controlled experiments. Companies that adopt video in their outreach are likely already more sophisticated in their sales process, creating selection bias. Vidyard has an obvious incentive to publish strong video email data. The 216% improvement from Terminus is likely not reproducible at scale.

---

### Drift / Qualified

**What they publish that's actually useful:**

Drift (now part of Salesloft) and Qualified focus on website-level buyer behavior:

1. **Analysis of 30M+ Drift conversations: B2B buyers crave instant digital buying experiences.** When presented with "Fastlane" (immediate chat engagement vs. form fill), 26-41% of all form fillers chose the instant option. This suggests a significant segment of inbound leads actively prefer real-time engagement over asynchronous email follow-up.

2. **Qualified's buyer behavior positioning:** Only 3% of website visitors self-identify through forms (consistent with 6sense data), meaning 97% of buying signals are invisible without website visitor identification technology.

**What's just product marketing (skip detail):**
Conversational AI features, chatbot capabilities, and real-time lead routing are all product features. The "Conversation Cloud" and "Buyer Engagement Platform" positioning are marketing language.

**Bias flag:** Drift/Qualified's entire business depends on the premise that form-fills are insufficient and real-time chat is superior, so all their published data supports this thesis. The 26-41% Fastlane adoption rate is interesting but reflects buyer behavior only when offered an alternative to forms -- it doesn't mean 26-41% of all buyers prefer chat.

## Cross-Company Synthesis: What's Actually New (2024-2026)

### Finding 1: The Day One Shortlist effect makes most cold outbound structurally disadvantaged
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED (multi-year 6sense data, 4,000+ buyer survey)
**Evidence:** 6sense 2025 Buyer Experience Report
**What's genuinely new vs repackaged:** Genuinely new at this specificity. The 85% to 95% year-over-year increase in Day One Shortlist win rates means the window for cold outreach to influence vendor selection is closing, not opening. Buying groups know 75% of vendors on their shortlist before contacting anyone. Only ~1 of 5 shortlist spots is available for unknown vendors. Buyers initiate 80%+ of first contacts. The strategic implication: cold email's primary role is shifting from "get on the shortlist" to "be memorable enough to make the Day One shortlist before the buying cycle begins" -- which requires brand, content, and community investment, not better email copy. This is a structural change in how outbound works, not a tactical one.

### Finding 2: The performance gap between top and average reps is 4-8x and widening
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED (Gong 28M+ emails, 300M+ calls)
**Evidence:** Gong cold email analysis, Gong cold calling analysis
**What's genuinely new vs repackaged:** The magnitude is genuinely new data. Top reps book 8.1x more meetings than average reps from cold email. Top cold callers book ~18 meetings/month vs. 2 for average. Top reps achieve 4.2x higher reply rates and 2.1x higher open rates. This gap is larger than most practitioners assume and suggests that "cold email doesn't work" is more accurately "cold email doesn't work for most people." The implication is that investing in rep skill development may produce higher ROI than investing in new channels or tools.

### Finding 3: Multi-channel is no longer optional -- it's the primary driver of email effectiveness
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED (Gong, Outreach, multi-channel research)
**Evidence:** Gong 300M call analysis, Outreach cadence data, industry benchmark data
**What's genuinely new vs repackaged:** The specific cross-channel causation data is genuinely new. Cold calling doubles email reply rates even when no connection occurs (Gong). Voicemails increase email reply rates from 2.73% to 5.87% (Gong). Email + LinkedIn converts 3.2x better than email alone. Adding phone increases qualified meetings by 47%. Outreach recommends maxing out at 3 email-only touches before switching channels. The new insight is not "use multiple channels" (old advice) but "the channels reinforce each other mechanistically" -- a voicemail creates awareness that makes the subsequent email recognizable, doubling its effectiveness. This is a network effect between channels, not just diversification.

### Finding 4: Pitching in cold emails is measurably destructive, not just suboptimal
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED (Gong 28M+ emails)
**Evidence:** Gong cold email analysis, Gong cold email stats
**What's genuinely new vs repackaged:** The magnitude is genuinely new. Pitching reduces reply rates by up to 57%. ROI language decreases success by 15%. Asking for "thoughts" decreases meetings by 20%. Buzzwords reduce open rates by 17.9%. "I never heard back" guilt-tripping decreases meetings by 14%. Most cold email advice says "don't pitch too hard" -- Gong's data says pitching at all in a cold email cuts your reply rate roughly in half. Meanwhile, nicety openers like "Hope all is well" increase meetings by 24%. This is counterintuitive to most SDR training programs.

### Finding 5: The AI-SDR hybrid model is winning, but most teams' data isn't ready
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED (Outreach, Salesloft, Clari Labs)
**Evidence:** Outreach 2025 data, Salesloft AI agents, Clari Labs 2026 research
**What's genuinely new vs repackaged:** The hybrid model data is new. 45% of teams use hybrid AI-SDR (Outreach). 100% of AI-SDR users save time; 52% report 10-25% pipeline increase. But 87% of enterprises missed revenue targets despite AI investment (Clari). 48% say data isn't AI-ready. 55% of sellers lack AI access (Salesloft). 57% say AI agents aren't fully deployed (Clari). The honest assessment: AI is producing incremental gains for teams that have clean data and proper implementation, but the majority of companies are not there yet. Teams should expect 40-60 hours of data preparation before AI SDR tools deliver value. This is a realism check on AI-SDR hype.

### Finding 6: Personalization effectiveness is buyer-seniority-dependent, not universal
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED (Gong 30K+ emails, 250+ companies, 2,300 classifiers)
**Evidence:** Gong personalization analysis, Gong reply rate methods
**What's genuinely new vs repackaged:** Genuinely new at this granularity. Individual personalization doubles replies for non-managerial roles but only lifts 50% for directors+. Company-specific personalization triples replies for executives but does nothing for individual contributors. Activity-based personalization (referencing engagement history) delivers 3x improvement for everyone. Industry-based personalization produces 88% lift. The implication: personalization strategy should change based on who you're targeting. For executives, talk about their company's strategic context. For ICs, reference their individual activity. This is a more sophisticated framework than "personalize everything."

### Finding 7: Social outreach is outperforming email for response rates, and the gap is widening
**Confidence:** SUPPORTED (HubSpot 1,000-person survey; corroborated by multi-channel data)
**Evidence:** HubSpot 2025 State of Sales, LinkedIn outreach benchmarks
**What's genuinely new vs repackaged:** The 42% vs. 26% response rate gap between social and email from HubSpot is a new benchmark. 35% of reps report social as their top source of high-quality leads. 90% of outbound effort still goes to email (industry data), despite social producing higher response rates. The mismatch between where effort goes (email) and where results come from (social) is the biggest tactical gap in outbound right now. However, this may reflect HubSpot's SMB/mid-market skew -- enterprise outbound may show different patterns.

### Finding 8: CTA strategy should change by engagement stage, not be universal
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED (Gong 304K emails analyzed)
**Evidence:** Gong CTA study
**What's genuinely new vs repackaged:** Genuinely new and actionable. Interest-based CTAs (asking if the prospect is interested, selling the conversation) convert at 2x the rate of specific meeting requests for cold emails. But in-deal emails, specific CTAs proposing a day and time more than double meetings booked (15% to 37%). Most outbound advice gives a single CTA recommendation. Gong's data shows the optimal CTA depends entirely on where you are in the relationship. Cold = soft and curiosity-driven. Warm = specific and direct.

### Finding 9: Free tools are the #1 lead generation mechanism, ahead of outbound
**Confidence:** SUPPORTED (HubSpot 1,000-person survey)
**Evidence:** HubSpot 2025 State of Sales
**What's genuinely new vs repackaged:** The specific ranking is noteworthy. 40% of sales professionals report free tools as the best-converting lead generation mechanism, ahead of gated content, webinars, and outbound. This directly addresses the user's interest in "where product meets virality/GTM" -- offering a free product experience that generates qualified leads produces better conversion than email outreach alone. This validates product-led outbound hybrid models where outbound follows product usage signals rather than cold targeting.

### Finding 10: Buyer research is compressing but touchpoints are not decreasing
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED (6sense 4,000+ buyers)
**Evidence:** 6sense 2025 Buyer Experience Report
**What's genuinely new vs repackaged:** Genuinely new as a combination finding. Buying cycles compressed from 11.3 to 10.1 months. First vendor contact moved from 69% to 61% of the journey. AI is in 89% of purchased solutions. But buyers still averaged 16 interactions per person with the winning vendor -- unchanged from last year. The implication is profound: AI is making buyers faster at research but not reducing the number of human interactions needed to buy. Sellers who think "AI means fewer touchpoints" are wrong. AI means faster cycles but the same touchpoint density, which means each interaction needs to be higher quality.

## Negative Searches

1. **Outreach has not published a standalone "State of Sales Execution" report for 2025-2026 as a downloadable benchmark.** Their data is distributed across blog posts and the 2025 Sales Data Report, but there's no single comprehensive benchmark document comparable to 6sense's Buyer Experience Report.

2. **Salesloft's "State of Revenue Engagement Benchmark Study" appears to have been last published in 2023** (pre-Vista Equity acquisition, pre-Clari merger). More recent data comes from the 2025 State of Pipeline Generation survey and Skills Gap survey, but these are smaller in scope.

3. **ZoomInfo has not published a standalone research report with benchmark data** comparable to Gong's cold email analysis or 6sense's buyer behavior study. Their content is primarily product-focused with occasional data points embedded in product marketing.

4. **Clari's research is focused on revenue forecasting and AI readiness**, not outbound email tactics. Their data is useful for framing the macro environment but does not provide email-specific benchmarks.

5. **Drift's research library appears to have been largely absorbed into Salesloft** after the acquisition. The most substantive Drift research (State of Conversational Marketing) was last published in 2021 with 2022 data. Recent content is product-focused.

6. **No company studied has published controlled A/B test data** comparing AI-generated vs. human-written cold emails at scale. Anecdotal and case study data exists, but rigorous comparative research is absent from all vendor sources.

7. **None of the primary companies publish granular data on email deliverability** (inbox placement rates, spam rates, bounce rates) in their public research. This is a critical gap given that Gmail/Outlook authentication changes (DMARC, SPF, DKIM) in 2024-2025 have fundamentally changed deliverability dynamics.

## Gaps / Follow-ups

1. **Download and analyze the Gong x 30MPC 85M cold email report PDF** (https://tactics.30mpc.com/hubfs/The%20Ultimate%20Cold%20Email%20Data%20Report-1.pdf) for additional granular data not covered in blog posts.

2. **6sense 2025 Buyer Experience Report full download** may contain additional data on how buyers use AI in their research process, which 6sense blogs reference but don't fully surface.

3. **Product usage data as outbound signal:** No vendor publishes substantive research on how product usage data (PLG signals) should be combined with outbound email. Outreach and ZoomInfo reference this conceptually but provide no benchmark data. This is the most important gap given the user's interest in product-GTM convergence.

4. **Email deliverability impact of AI-generated content:** With Gmail/Outlook tightening spam filters and DMARC requirements in 2024-2025, there should be data on whether AI-generated emails are caught by spam filters more frequently. No vendor publishes this data, likely because it would undermine their AI email products.

5. **Industry-specific cold email benchmarks from major platforms:** Gong and Outreach both reference industry variation in performance but don't publish systematic cross-industry benchmark tables in their public content. SaaS (~7.4% reply rate) and healthcare (~7.5%) are mentioned; financial services (~6.7%) is the lowest cited.

6. **Video email adoption at scale:** Vidyard publishes case studies but no large-scale adoption data showing what percentage of outbound teams use video, what the typical performance lift is outside of case study cherry-picking, or what the production cost/time overhead is.

7. **The Clari + Salesloft merged dataset** (10B+ revenue interactions, 1T data signals) should produce the most comprehensive cross-platform outbound research ever published. Watch for publications from this combined entity in 2026.
