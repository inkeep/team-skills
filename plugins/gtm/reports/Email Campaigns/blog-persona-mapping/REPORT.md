### 5.4 Content Creator (Recruiting)

**What they care about:** Budget constraints (only 8% have dedicated budget), video production cost, time pressure, reaching young talent

| Article | Why It Resonates | Suggested CTA | Buying Stage |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| [The Rise of In-App AI Assistants](https://inkeep.com/blog/The-Rise-of-In-App-AI-Assistants-How-Agentic-AI) | Content efficiency, engagement patterns | "Video posts get 200-300% more engagement. This covers how AI is changing content creation." | Awareness |
| [Interactive Docs - Competitive Edge](https://inkeep.com/blog/interactive-docs-the-new-competitive-edge-for-devtools-in-20) | Content differentiation | "Interactive content is becoming table stakes. Relevant for employer branding content." | Awareness |

**CTA Style:** Focus on time savings and cost vs. agency. They have limited budgets and need multi-level buy-in.

**Anti-pattern:** Don't ignore budget reality — only 8% have dedicated employer branding budget. Lead with efficiency, not features.

**Note:** Limited direct article matches — consider case studies showing content efficiency gains.
