### Email Content (Step 1 — Manual Work)
- **Subject Line:** Reduce manual work, higher CSAT
- **Email Body:** Hi {{first_name}}, A lot of "bad CX" in technical support is really manual work hidden from customers: Support Agents hunting across docs, logs, configs, and old cases before anyone can give a confident update. Customers experience that as: slower progress → longer time-to-value, more back-and-forth → higher journey CES, inconsistent answers → hits relationship NPS / trust, repeated friction → shows up in churn reasons. We wrote a short guide on how technical B2B teams should measure AI agents in a way that maps to CX outcomes.

### Email Content (Step 1 — Manual Work)
- **Subject Line:** Ask AI that goes beyond T1 deflection
- **Email Body:** Hi {{first_name}}, Biggest waste in T2/T3 is still time to reproduce. Not because engineers can't debug, because repro starts with a 6+ system lookup scavenger hunt (env/version, configs, logs, traces, prior cases) before anyone can even try. That back-and-forth blocks everything: resolution, escalations, bug fixes. We wrote a short post on what Technical B2B Support Leaders should prepare for in 2026.

### Email Content (Step 1 — Manual Work)
- **Subject Line:** Ask AI that reduces AHT
- **Email Body:** Hi {{first_name}}, For support teams, AHT is rarely about typing speed, it's about how long agents spend gathering context before they can act. As cases get more complex, agents bounce between docs, past tickets, and internal notes just to understand what's going on. That manual work is what quietly pushes AHT up. Worth a short read on how teams reduce AHT by eliminating manual ticket summarization and reporting?
- **First Line:** For support teams, AHT is rarely about typing speed, it's about how long agents spend gathering context before they can act.
- **CTA Link:** "manual ticket" → https://go.inkeep.com/K3Yju0T

### Email Content (Step 1 — Fragmented)
- **Subject Line:** fragmented AI increases AHT
- **First Line:** For support teams, fragmented AI usually shows up in the numbers before it shows up in complaints.

## Key Learnings

### Best Open Rate
**VP of Support Sequence: Full Auto (Q1) — 66.0%**
Likely benefits from a smaller, more targeted prospect list (46 active prospects). The subject line "Automate manual support work in 5 min" with a time-bound, action-oriented hook appears to resonate strongly with VP of Support personas.

### Best Click Rate
**VP of Support Sequence: Full Auto (Q1) — 45.3%**
The "deflection" CTA anchored to a guide on measuring AI support agents beyond deflection drives the highest click-through. Pairing a relevant pain point (T1 plateau) with a concrete CTA performs best for this audience.

### Highest Volume Sequence
**Support Engineering & Technical Support (Manager+) (Q1) — 1,868 delivered**
Largest list with consistently solid engagement (50% open rate, 25.9% click rate). The T2/T3 repro pain point ("Biggest waste in T2/T3 is still time to reproduce") resonates across a large technical audience.

### Lowest Open Rate
**B2B nonTechnical VP of Support: Full Auto (Q1) — 33.3%**
Very early stage (only 21 delivered / 7 active prospects). Not enough volume to draw conclusions. Needs more prospecting to be statistically meaningful.

### Lowest Click Rate
**B2B nonTechnical VP of CX: Full Auto (Q1) — 14.5%**
Despite using the same "Reduce manual work, higher CSAT" angle as VP of CX Sequence, the B2B nonTechnical CX audience is less responsive. The CX outcomes CTA may not be compelling enough for this segment — consider testing a more specific, outcome-driven link.

### Reply Rate Observations
Reply rates are near 0% across all sequences, with only Support Engineering and B2B nonTechnical CS generating 1 reply each. The sequences are click-focused (content-led) rather than reply-focused. To improve reply rates, consider:
- Adding a direct question in the closing line (e.g., "Is this a priority for your team right now?")
- Testing a short, plain-text variant with no CTA link
- Including a specific ask in follow-up steps (e.g., "Would a 15-min call be worth it?")

### Technical vs. B2B nonTechnical Comparison
Technical sequences (Support Engineering, Support Ops) generally outperform their B2B nonTechnical counterparts on click rates. The T2/T3 repro pain point and AHT framing resonates more with technical audiences who experience the friction daily. The nonTechnical sequences may benefit from more business-outcome framing (cost, churn, NPS) rather than workflow/process framing.

### CTA Link Performance
Three distinct CTA links were used:
- **https://go.inkeep.com/DqaJSmZ** — Used in VP of CX, VP of Support, B2B VP of CX, B2B VP of Support sequences
- **https://go.inkeep.com/VDhW1X3** — Used in Support Engineering and B2B nonTechncial Ops sequences (B2B Support Leaders guide)
- **https://go.inkeep.com/K3Yju0T** — Used in Support Operations sequence (manual ticket summarization guide)
- **https://go.inkeep.com/oFEQG4h** — Used in B2B nonTechnical CS sequence (Ask AI post)

The VDhW1X3 link (B2B Support Leaders guide) achieved the highest absolute click volume (592 clicks across two sequences), suggesting the "what leaders should prepare for in 2026" framing drives strong content engagement.
