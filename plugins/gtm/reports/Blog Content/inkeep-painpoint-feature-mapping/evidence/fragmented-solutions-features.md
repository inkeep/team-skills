## Pain Point Summary

Technical B2B SaaS companies adopt piecemeal AI solutions that:
- Don't integrate with each other
- Don't connect to company knowledge sources, customer data, or 1st-party APIs
- Create vendor sprawl, security burden, and adoption friction
- Bottleneck companies on vendor roadmaps

**Key Statistics:**
- 106 SaaS apps average per enterprise (Zylo)
- 95% cite integration as #1 AI adoption barrier (MuleSoft)
- 81% of CX leaders want single-system consolidation (Zendesk)
- 42% higher security incidents with 10+ AI tools (IBM)
