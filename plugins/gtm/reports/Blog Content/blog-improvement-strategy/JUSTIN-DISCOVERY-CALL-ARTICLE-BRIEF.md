# Write With Me: What Actually Happens on an Inkeep Discovery Call

You're going to write a blog article about how Inkeep runs discovery calls and builds custom demos. This prompt will ask you questions, then write the article using your answers.

**Format:** 600-900 words, scannable (tables + bullets), with one narrative moment
**Goal:** Build trust, show expertise, drive demo bookings without being salesy

---

## Before We Start

The best content comes from specific moments, not generic descriptions. As you answer these questions, think of **real calls you remember** — the ones that stuck with you.

---

## Section 1: The Hook

I need a specific moment from a discovery call that shows why your process is different.

**Tell me about a recent call where a prospect said something that surprised you, challenged you, or revealed why most demos fail.**

Include:
- Who were they? (role, not name)
- What did they say? (exact words if you remember)
- Why did it stick with you?

---

## Section 2: Why Most Demos Fail

**What are the 3 biggest mistakes you see other vendors make in demos?**

For each one, tell me:
- What they do wrong
- Why it fails (from the prospect's perspective)

---

## Section 3: Discovery Questions

**What are 5 questions you always ask in discovery calls?**

For each question:
- The exact question you ask
- Why you ask it (what it reveals)

---

## Section 4: Building the Demo

**What happens between the discovery call and the demo?**

Walk me through the steps:
- What do you actually do to prepare?
- How long does it take?
- What makes it "custom" vs. canned?

---

## Section 5: The Demo Moment

This is the most important part. I need one specific story.

**Tell me about a moment in a demo when something clicked for a prospect.**

Include:
- What they saw (their docs? their customer question?)
- What happened (their reaction, what they said)
- Why this moment matters

Be specific — "a Support Ops manager unmuted and said 'wait, that's actually right'" is better than "they were impressed."

---

## Section 6: When You Say No

**When do you tell a prospect Inkeep isn't the right fit?**

Give me 3-4 honest disqualifiers:
- The situation
- Why it doesn't work

---

## Section 7: The Close

**How do you want readers to feel after reading this?**

And: **What's one sentence that captures your philosophy about discovery calls?**

---

## Once You've Answered Everything

Paste all your answers, and I'll write the article in this structure:

2. **Why Most Demos Fail** — Table from your answers
3. **What We Ask in Discovery** — Table of your 5 questions
4. **How We Build Your Demo** — Bullets from your prep process
5. **The Demo Itself** (150 words) — Your story, written as narrative
6. **When We're Not a Fit** — Your honest disqualifiers
7. **Close** (50 words) — Your philosophy, as invitation

## Voice I'll Use

- First person ("I ask this because...")
- Specific, not generic
- Confident but not salesy
- Honest about limitations
- No "book a demo!" CTA — ends with curiosity
