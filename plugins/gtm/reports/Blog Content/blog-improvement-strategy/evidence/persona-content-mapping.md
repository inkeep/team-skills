## Findings

### Finding: Executive personas (CEO, CTO, CIO) require outcome-focused content with quantified ROI

**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** B2B Persona Messaging Playbook + Edelman research

**Persona-Specific Patterns:**

| Persona | Primary Metric Concern | Content Type That Converts | Format Preference |
|---------|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| CEO/Founder | CAC, NRR, growth efficiency | ROI case studies, market analysis | Short, scannable, data-led |
| CTO | Developer productivity, security | Technical deep-dives, architecture posts | Can be longer, must be substantive |
| CIO/Head of AI | POC-to-production, AI ROI | Governance frameworks, implementation guides | Executive summaries with detail available |

**Supporting Evidence:**
- CEOs complete 60%+ of buying process before engaging vendor
- 41% have preferred vendor before formal evaluation
- CTOs: 73% expected to adopt GenAI solutions by end of 2024
- CIOs: 42% abandoned most AI initiatives in 2025

**Implications:** Content must demonstrate business impact quickly. CEOs scan in 5-7 seconds; if the value isn't immediately clear, they bounce.

### Finding: Support/CX personas have distinct content needs by level

**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Persona Messaging Playbook evidence files

**VP of CX:**
- Primary pain: Proving ROI to leadership
- Content need: Business case templates, NRR improvement stories
- CTA: Specific date/time doubles bookings (15% → 37%)

**Support Leaders (Manager+):**
- Primary pain: Knowledge gaps (51%), scaling
- Content need: Benchmark reports, efficiency calculators
- CTA: ROI calculator, assessment tool

**Support Ops:**
- Primary pain: Tool sprawl, integration complexity
- Content need: Technical integration guides, architecture diagrams
- CTA: API documentation, technical demo

**Customer Success Leaders:**
- Primary pain: Burnout, lack of strategic seat
- Content need: Tactical playbooks, templates
- CTA: Free template, checklist

**Implications:** A single "CX content" strategy fails. Each sub-persona requires different depth, tone, and CTAs.

### Finding: Developer-adjacent personas (DevRel, Docs, Community) are skeptical of marketing

**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Persona Messaging Playbook + State of Developer Relations report

**Detection patterns:**
- They identify as practitioners first
- Detect sales tactics instantly
- Value technical substance over marketing polish

**What works:**
- Reference their public work (talks, blogs, podcasts)
- Provide immediately usable value
- Technical how-tos, not thought leadership
- Free trial > demo request

**Anti-patterns that kill response:**
- "Let me pick your brain" outreach
- Generic personalization
- Calendar links in first email
- Buzzword-heavy messaging

**Implications:** Content for these personas should feel like peer-to-peer technical sharing, not vendor marketing.

### Finding: Content consumption varies dramatically by persona

**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Persona Messaging Playbook research

| Persona | Primary Channels | Format Preference |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| CEO | Email newsletters (4x engagement vs social), founder podcasts | Short, outcome-focused |
| CTO | Lenny's Newsletter, Pragmatic Engineer, Hacker News | Technical depth acceptable |
| VP of CX | Gain Grow Retain community, CX podcasts | ROI frameworks, case studies |
| Support Ops | Support Driven, tool-specific communities | API docs, implementation guides |
| DevRel | DevRel Collective, developer Slack groups | Code examples, integration tutorials |
| Tech Writers | Write the Docs Slack (21k+) | Docs-as-code, workflow guides |
| Product Leaders | Lenny's Newsletter, Mind the Product Slack (60k+) | Frameworks, user data analysis |

**Implications:** Distribution strategy must be persona-specific. A great article placed in the wrong channel reaches no one.

---

### Finding: Budget authority determines CTA strategy

**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Persona Messaging Playbook

**Full budget authority (direct demo ask acceptable):**
- CEO, Founder, Chairman (company-wide)
- CTO (engineering/dev tools)
- VP of CX (CX tools)
- CIO, Head of AI (explicit mandate)

**Partial/growing authority (softer CTA needed):**
- Support Leaders (VP: Full / Manager: Influence)
- CS Leaders (may need VP approval)
- Product Leaders (shared with CEO)
- Support Ops ($10K-$50K; larger needs approval)

**Limited authority (value-first approach):**
- Junior/Mid-level PMs (rarely/no budget)
- Technical Writers (strong influencer only)
- Junior DevRel (limited influence)

**CTA Calibration:**

| Authority Level | CTA Approach |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Full | "Book a demo" appropriate |
| Partial | "See how [peer company] did X" |
| Limited | "Try free" / "Get the template" |

**Implications:** Asking an IC to "book a demo" when they can't approve purchases damages trust and wastes everyone's time.

### Finding: Interest-based CTAs outperform direct booking requests

**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Gong research, Belkins data, persona playbook

**Data points:**
- Interest-based CTAs: 30% response rate
- Direct booking CTAs: 15% response rate
- Personalized CTAs: 202% better conversion than generic
- Question-phrased CTAs: Double reply rates

**Interest-based CTA examples:**
- "Would it be helpful to see..."
- "Want me to share how [similar company]..."
- "Would a quick 2-min Loom be useful?"

**Direct booking (lower performance):**
- "Book a demo"
- "Schedule a call"
- "Let's set up a meeting"

**Implications:** Lower the commitment ask. Interest confirmation before scheduling increases conversion.

## Gaps / Follow-ups

* Industry-specific content mapping (healthcare, fintech, enterprise) not covered
* Regional variation in content preferences not researched
* Company stage (seed vs. Series C) content differences need deeper analysis
