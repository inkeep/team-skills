## Findings

### Finding: AI Overviews appear on 13-21% of queries and cause a 61% drop in organic CTR where they appear; HubSpot organic visits fell from ~13.5M to under 7M in one month
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Multiple SEO studies, HubSpot public data. Median publisher saw 10% YoY traffic decline in H1 2025; non-news content sites down 14%.

**Critical nuance:** Brands cited *within* AI Overviews earn 35% more organic clicks and 91% more paid clicks. The strategy shifts from "ranking" to "being cited."

Top cited domains: YouTube (~23.3%), Wikipedia (~18.4%), Google.com (~16.4%), Reddit, LinkedIn, Facebook. Winner-takes-most: top 5 domains capture 38% of all citations.

### Finding: AI citation factors differ fundamentally from traditional SEO — original data earns 4.1x more citations; 50% of Perplexity citations reference content published in the current year
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Perplexity citation analysis.

**Key AI citation factors:**
- Content quality and relevance over keyword density
- Structured/extractable content (headings, lists, tables)
- Original data (4.1x more citations)
- Clear authorship with credentials
- Freshness (Perplexity content decay begins 2-3 days post-publication)
- 70% of general Perplexity queries cite content with visuals
- Schema markup, fast page speeds, proper HTML structure

### Finding: 58-65% of all Google searches are now zero-click; for AI Overview queries specifically, 83% zero-click; projected 70%+ by end of 2025/2026
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Multiple search analytics studies.

**Strategic adaptation:**
- Create layered content: surface answer for AI + deeper analysis requiring click-through
- Invest in interactive tools that cannot be summarized
- Build direct audience channels (email, community)
- Shift success metric from "traffic driven" to "brand cited"

### Finding: AI-proof content types — original research (67% of marketers say more valuable for trust), first-hand experience, genuine expert POV, interactive tools, community content
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** B2B marketing surveys. 59% of buyers see near-identical content from competing vendors. Generic informational content is fully replicable by AI and actively losing traffic.

### Finding: AI-assisted writing best practice — humans lead on strategy, angle, thesis, insight; AI assists with research, outlines, drafts, editing, formatting
**Confidence:** INFERRED (emerging consensus)

**Human-only domains:**
- Strategic angle and thesis
- Brand voice
- Experience-based claims
- Nuanced judgment
- Fact-checking (AI hallucination risk)

**Generic content trap signals:** Formulaic phrases, "both sides" framing, content that could apply to any competitor.

### Finding: Google's position — quality matters, not authorship method; AI content is not penalized per se; March 2024 update reduced low-quality content by ~45%
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Google official statements, March 2024 core update data, Scaled Content Abuse policy, January 2025 Quality Rater Guidelines.

E-E-A-T is the framework determining whether AI-assisted content performs. Google calls Trustworthiness "the most important member."

### Finding: 80% of B2B buyers trust AI tools at least sometimes, but 62% of frequent users always fact-check; 90% click through AI Overview sources to verify; disclosing AI authorship degrades perceived authenticity
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** B2B buyer trust surveys, academic research on AI authorship disclosure.

94% of marketers agree trust is the most important B2B brand factor. AI can be part of the process, but final content must demonstrate genuine human expertise and original perspective.

- AI Overview citation patterns are evolving rapidly; 2025 data may shift by 2026
- Zero-click projections are estimates, not confirmed
- "AI-proof content" thesis is early-stage; long-term data limited
- Google's stance on AI content continues to evolve
