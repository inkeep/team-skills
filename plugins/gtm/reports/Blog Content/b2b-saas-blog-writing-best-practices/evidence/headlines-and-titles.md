## Findings

### Finding: "How to" headlines dominate B2B performance — 3x more shares than next-best format
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** BuzzSumo 10M LinkedIn articles; InPowered found "How-to" headlines achieved 76% post-click engagement (highest of any format)

### Finding: Numbered headlines are the #1 reader preference (36% prefer them)
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Conductor survey; BuzzSumo confirmed list posts were 2nd strongest B2B format. Best-performing numbers in B2B: 5, 10, 3, 7, 4, 6.

### Finding: Question headlines boost CTR by 14.1%
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Backlinko 5M query study

### Finding: Meta titles should be 50-60 characters; display titles (H1) can be 7-12 words
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Backlinko (15-40 chars had 8.6% higher CTR); Search Engine Land (Google measures by pixel width, 580-600px desktop); BuzzSumo (7-12 words optimal for B2B social)

### Finding: Google rewrites 60-76% of title tags; staying at 51-55 chars reduces rewrite rate to ~40%
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Zyppy study, Search Engine Land 2025

### Finding: Generic "power words" (Ultimate, Secret, Amazing) DECREASE CTR by 13.9% in Google SERPs
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Backlinko 5M query study

**Implications:** The words that sound "marketing-y" actively hurt search performance. They signal clickbait.

### Finding: Emotional B2B campaigns are 7x more effective long-term, but emotion must be professional
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** B2B Institute (Binet & Field research). Key B2B emotions: trust, reliability, security, confidence, ambition. NOT consumer-style fear/excitement.

### Finding: Positive emotional sentiment boosts CTR 4-7%, but hyperbolic power words hurt it
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Backlinko — the resolution is: use genuinely positive framing, not clickbait-y superlatives.

### Finding: Superlatives should be limited to 0-1 per headline; 2-3 superlatives is the worst-performing range
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Conductor study — 51% of readers preferred zero or one superlative.

### Finding: Meta title and H1 should be semantically aligned but can differ tactically
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Search Engine Journal, Yoast — front-load keywords in meta title; use H1 for engagement hooks. Google may penalize/rewrite misaligned titles.

### Finding: Clickbait headlines are shared ~50x less than non-clickbait headlines
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Mailchimp analysis

1. **Clickbait** — shared 50x less, high bounce, potential SEO penalties
2. **Generic power words in SEO titles** — -13.9% CTR
3. **Jargon-heavy titles** — reduces discoverability, alienates adjacent audiences
4. **Vague, benefit-free titles** — fails "what will I learn?" test
5. **2-3 superlatives** — worst-performing range
6. **Ignoring search intent** — title must match a real query
7. **Neglecting mobile truncation** — Google shows ~430px on mobile (~40-50 chars); front-load value

## Gaps / follow-ups

- BuzzSumo B2B data is LinkedIn-specific; performance may differ for organic search
- Conductor study is not B2B-specific
- No large-scale study specifically on B2B SaaS headline formats (vs B2B broadly)
