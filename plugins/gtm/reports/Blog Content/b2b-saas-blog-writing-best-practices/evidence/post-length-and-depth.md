## Findings

### Finding: Average blog post length in 2025 is 1,333 words; 2,000+ word posts report nearly 2x "strong results"
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Orbit Media 2025 Survey (n=808)

- Average post: 1,333 words (down from 1,427 peak)
- Only 9% of bloggers write 2,000+ word posts
- Those who do report "strong results" at 39% vs 21% overall benchmark
- Average time to write: 3 hours 46 minutes
- Average length increased 77% over the past decade

**Implications:** Longer posts correlate with stronger results, but the mechanism is depth/effort, not word count itself.

### Finding: HubSpot's SEO sweet spot is 2,250-2,500 words; lead gen sweet spot extends to 2,500-3,000
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** HubSpot analysis of 6,192 internal blog posts

- SEO sweet spot: 2,250-2,500 words for max organic traffic
- Lead generation: 2,500-3,000 words
- Posts over 3,000 words saw 56% less traffic than the 2,250-2,500 sweet spot
- Clear diminishing returns beyond 3,000 words

**Implications:** There is a ceiling. Going beyond ~3,000 words hurts traffic unless the format explicitly warrants it (pillar/ultimate guide).

### Finding: Content over 3,000 words earns 77.2% more backlinks; 94% of all content earns zero backlinks regardless of length
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Backlinko/BuzzSumo study of 912M blog posts

- 3,000+ words: 77.2% more referring domain backlinks vs sub-1,000 words
- 1,000-2,000 words: 56.1% more social shares vs sub-1,000 words
- Diminishing returns on social shares beyond ~2,000 words
- 94% of all blog content earns zero backlinks regardless of length
- No correlation between social shares and backlinks (independent signals)

**Implications:** Length helps for link acquisition, but the base rate is extremely low — quality and promotion matter far more than length alone.

### Finding: Google top-10 average word count is ~1,447 words, but Google explicitly states word count is NOT a ranking factor
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Backlinko SERP analysis (11.8M results) + Google public statements

**Implications:** Correlation exists because comprehensive content covers more topically, not because of word count per se.

### Finding: Optimal length varies significantly by content type
**Confidence:** INFERRED (expert consensus, no single head-to-head study)

| Content Type | Recommended Range |
|---|---|
| How-to / Tutorial | 1,700-2,500 words |
| Thought Leadership | 1,200-2,000 words |
| Comparison / vs. Posts | 2,000-3,000 words |
| Listicles | 1,000-2,000 words |
| Product Updates / News | 500-800 words |
| Pillar / Ultimate Guide | 3,000-5,000+ words |

### Finding: Content-intent fit matters more than absolute word count
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED (directional, supported by multiple studies)

A 3,000-word post answering a 500-word question bounces readers. A 700-word comparison feels thin. The question is not "long or short?" but "does the depth match the intent?"

### Finding: B2B audiences tolerate and expect longer content due to extended buying cycles
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Gartner: B2B buyers spend 27% of buying journey researching independently online. CMI: top B2B formats are research reports (53%), blog posts (52%), ebooks (48%).

**Implications:** B2B SaaS can confidently write longer than B2C, but must structure for selective reading (executives scan, practitioners read deeply).

## Gaps / follow-ups

- No study isolates B2B SaaS specifically (most data is B2B broadly or all blogs)
- Length vs engagement data is correlational, not causal
- Technical audience length preferences specifically understudied
