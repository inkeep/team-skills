## Findings: Frameworks

### Finding: Eight distinct frameworks exist for defining brand voice — each serves a different purpose
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED

| Framework | Core Idea | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **Voice & Tone Model** | Voice is constant personality; tone varies by context | Foundation for any voice system |
| **Brand Archetypes** (Jung) | 12 personality archetypes mapped to brand motivation | Strategic positioning |
| **Voice Attribute Matrix** | 3-column chart: trait, description, do/don't | Day-to-day content reference |
| **Base Notes / Grace Notes** (Kessler) | Constant base traits + variable accent traits | B2B content teams |
| **"This But Not That"** (Mailchimp) | Contrasting pairs defining boundaries | Immediate personality clarity |
| **BrandSort** (Bloomstein) | Card sort → hierarchical communication goals | Workshop facilitation |
| **Four Dimensions** (NNGroup) | Four measurable spectrums (formal-casual, serious-funny, respectful-irreverent, matter-of-fact-enthusiastic) | Research-backed calibration |
| **Personality Sliders** (GV Sprint) | Spectrum positioning in 3-hour sprint | Fast startup alignment |

### Finding: The "This But Not That" framework is the most immediately actionable — used by Mailchimp, Slack, and widely recommended
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED

**Mailchimp's canonical pairs:** Fun but not childish, clever but not silly, confident but not cocky, smart but not stodgy, cool but not alienating, informal but not sloppy, helpful but not overbearing.

**Slack's pairs:** Confident but never cocky, witty but never silly, conversational but always appropriate, friendly but not ingratiating, helpful never overbearing.

### Finding: Kessler's Base Notes / Grace Notes uses a perfume analogy — 3-4 constant base traits + contextual accent traits, filtered through "Three Cs" (Clarity, Confidence, Compellingness)
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Velocity Partners published work, CMWorld presentations.

Base notes: Open, Honest, Passionate, Authoritative.
Grace notes (vary by context): Witty, Edgy, Statesmanlike, Breathless, Angry.
Formula: Story × Voice = Impact (either at zero yields zero).

### Finding: NNGroup's four tone dimensions produce measurable differences in user perception — casual, conversational, enthusiastic tones perform best
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** NNGroup user study (n=50, statistically significant at p<0.05). ~0.5-1 point differences on 5-point scales for realistic tone variations.

### Finding: Brand archetypes — most B2B SaaS brands lean Sage, Ruler, or Creator as primary, often with Caregiver or Magician secondary
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Focus Lab, Userlist analysis of B2B SaaS brands.

Notable mappings: Stripe = Hero, Mailchimp = Jester, Notion = Everyman, Slack = Magician, GitHub = Explorer.

### Finding: Bloomstein's BrandSort exercise produces a prioritized hierarchy of communication goals, not a flat list — resolves conflicts between competing brand attributes
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Margot Bloomstein, *Content Strategy at Work*. Three-step card sort: "who we are" → "who we'd like to be" → "who we're not."

## Findings: Voice Discovery Process

### Finding: Seven-step voice discovery process with specific inputs and exercises
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED (practitioner consensus)

1. **Stakeholder workshop** — card sorts, slider exercises, attribute brainstorming. Narrow to 4-5 core words.
2. **Customer research** — support tickets, reviews, sales calls. How does your audience talk?
3. **Competitor analysis** — map competitor voice positioning, find differentiation gaps.
4. **Existing content audit** — which pieces match intended voice? Read posts aloud.
5. **Inspiration brand identification** — what brands (any industry) have the voice you aspire to?
6. **Codification** — document into voice chart with traits, descriptions, do's/don'ts.
7. **Regular review** — content audit every 6 months for alignment.

### Finding: Ten key workshop exercises for voice discovery
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED

Most impactful: Brand Personification ("brand as a person at a dinner party"), "This But Not That" list, Social Media Voice Audit (read posts aloud), NNGroup Tone Dimensions rating, BrandSort card sort, Personality Sliders (GV Sprint), Dream Spokesperson.

## Findings: Voice Documentation

### Finding: Effective voice guides are comprehensive in content, concise in presentation — 2-5 pages with examples, not 50-page bibles
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Kessler recommends 2-5 pages. Multiple sources warn: "Those 50-page brand bibles? Nobody reads them."

**Must include:** Core personality (3-5 adjectives), "This But Not That" pairs, tone variations by context, do's/don'ts with before/after examples, channel-specific guidance, branded terminology.

**Best format:** Central online platform (Notion, wiki, microsite), modular structure (quick-reference one-pager + deeper sections), living document.

### Finding: Mailchimp's Content Style Guide is universally cited as the gold standard — a dedicated microsite, open-sourced under Creative Commons
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** styleguide.mailchimp.com. Brand character: "The Expert Absurdist." Four voice principles: Plainspoken, Genuine, Translator, Dry humor. Five writing goals: Empower, Respect, Educate, Guide, Speak Truth.

### Finding: Grammarly Business "Brand Tones" feature makes teams 40% more on-brand (beta data)
**Confidence:** INFERRED (self-reported beta data from vendor)
**Evidence:** Grammarly Business. Select from 50+ tones, upload style guides, get real-time voice enforcement.

## Findings: Real-World Voice Examples

| Company | Voice Character | Key Distinguisher |
|---|---|---|
| **Mailchimp** | Expert Absurdist — plainspoken, genuine, dry humor | Most comprehensive public guide; open-sourced |
| **Stripe** | Hero — technical precision, empowerment | Writing as culture; onboarding classes; Markdoc for CI enforcement |
| **Slack** | Magician — clear, concise, human | Three-tier system; character never overwhelms content |
| **Intercom** | Conversational, clear, confident, delightful | PREACH framework for support; productized tone in AI agent |
| **Atlassian** | Bold, optimistic, practical with a wink | Applied to everyone (designers, engineers, PMs, not just writers) |
| **Buffer** | Relatable, genuine, inclusive | Honors individual writer voices within brand boundaries |
| **DigitalOcean** | Friendly but formal, empowering | Every tutorial starts with clear goal, no fluff, no assumptions |

## Gaps / follow-ups

- Most voice guides are from larger, well-funded companies; limited data on how early-stage startups should approach this
- Grammarly's "40% more on-brand" claim is self-reported beta data
- NNGroup study was n=50; larger replication would strengthen findings
- Limited quantitative data on voice consistency impact on business outcomes (engagement, conversion, retention)
