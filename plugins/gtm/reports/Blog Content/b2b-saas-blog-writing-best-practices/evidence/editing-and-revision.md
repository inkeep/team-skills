## Findings

### Finding: Three-pass editing framework — always work macro to micro (developmental → line → copy)
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Professional editorial standards, multiple sources.

| Pass | Focus | Key Questions |
|---|---|---|
| **Developmental editing** | Structure, argument, angle, completeness | Does the post deliver on its thesis? Is the structure logical? Are sections in the right order? Is anything missing or redundant? |
| **Line editing** | Sentence clarity, voice, flow, transitions | Is every sentence clear? Does the voice feel consistent? Do transitions connect ideas? Is there unnecessary jargon? |
| **Copyediting** | Grammar, consistency, accuracy, formatting | Are facts verified? Is formatting consistent? Are there typos or grammatical errors? Do links work? |

**Critical principle:** Fixing grammar before structure is wasted effort — structural changes may eliminate entire sections.

### Finding: Cooling-off period of 24-48 hours minimum before editing; reading aloud catches problems silent reading misses
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Multiple editorial sources. Reading aloud triggers different brain areas, catching rhythm problems and awkward phrasing that silent reading skips.

**Four core self-editing techniques:**
1. **Cooling-off period** — 24-48 hours for short posts, up to 2-4 weeks for long-form
2. **Reading aloud** — catches flow, rhythm, and phrasing issues
3. **Reverse outlining** — create an outline after drafting to verify structural integrity
4. **Brief-checking** — verify draft against original content brief before style editing

### Finding: Formal editing yields 35% relative improvement — 31% report strong results with formal editing vs 23% without
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Orbit Media 2025 survey.

**Recommended 4-stage workflow for small SaaS teams:**
1. Self-edit (cooling period + macro review)
2. Peer review (subject matter accuracy + readability)
3. Editorial review (voice, clarity, SEO, formatting)
4. Pre-publish QA (links, images, meta, mobile check)

### Finding: Bloggers spending 6+ hours per post are 60-120% more likely to report strong results than those spending 1-2 hours
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Orbit Media 2025 survey.

Additional data:
- 38% of bloggers using multiple editors report strong results vs 34% with just one
- Only 32% of bloggers use formal editing — significant competitive opportunity
- Semrush: 62% of high-performing posts are easy or fairly easy to read

### Finding: Comprehensive editing checklist spans 9 categories
**Confidence:** INFERRED (synthesized from multiple sources)

1. **Content/Strategy** — Does it answer the reader's question? Clear thesis? Matches search intent?
2. **Structure/Readability** — H-tag hierarchy? Short paragraphs? Scannable formatting?
3. **Voice/Tone/Style** — Consistent with brand voice? Appropriate for audience?
4. **Accuracy/Credibility** — Facts verified? Sources cited? Claims substantiated?
5. **SEO/Discoverability** — Keywords placed? Meta description written? Internal links added?
6. **Visual/Formatting** — Images included? Alt text? Mobile-friendly?
7. **Grammar/Mechanics** — Proofread? Consistent style (Oxford comma, capitalization, etc.)?
8. **Conversion/CTA** — CTA present? Matches funnel stage? Clear next step?
9. **Final Pre-Publish** — Links work? Images load? Mobile preview checked? Scheduled?

### Finding: Six common editing mistakes
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED

1. **Editing too soon** — still in "creator mode," miss structural problems
2. **Focusing on grammar before structure** — micro-optimizing content that may get cut
3. **Over-editing / removing voice** — polishing until it reads like a corporate memo
4. **Under-editing / publishing first drafts** — most common mistake in content teams
5. **Not fact-checking claims** — statistics, quotes, and links go stale or were wrong to begin with
6. **Over-relying on AI editing tools** — AI catches grammar but misses strategic and voice issues

### Finding: AI editing is the #1 AI use case per Orbit Media, but no strong correlation between AI usage and better performance; human-written articles generate 5.44x more traffic
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Orbit Media (AI use case data); traffic comparison study.

**Where AI editing helps:** Grammar checking, readability scoring, consistency checking, formatting suggestions.

**Where human judgment is essential:** Brand voice, strategic angle, fact-checking, emotional resonance, argument quality.

Human-written articles hold attention 41% longer than purely AI-generated content.

## Gaps / follow-ups

- Orbit Media editing data is self-reported (bloggers rating their own results)
- The 5.44x traffic figure for human vs AI content may conflate quality with other factors (domain authority, promotion, etc.)
- No study specifically measures editing ROI for B2B SaaS blogs (vs blogs broadly)
- Optimal number of editing passes lacks quantitative validation
