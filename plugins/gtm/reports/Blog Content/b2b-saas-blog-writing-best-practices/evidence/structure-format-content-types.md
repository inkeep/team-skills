## Findings: Structure & Format

### Finding: Use exactly one H1 per page, 4-10 H2s for a 2,000-word post, H3s for sub-sections within H2 blocks
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** SEO best practices + NNGroup eye-tracking confirms "layer-cake scanning pattern" where users fixate primarily on headings.

- Never skip heading levels (H1→H3 without H2)
- Keep headings to 8-10 words
- Headings should be descriptive (convey the section's key point, not just label the topic)

### Finding: Paragraphs should be 2-3 sentences; sections under one H2 should be 200-500 words; sentences 25 words or fewer
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** NNGroup research + web readability studies. Transitional text between sections should be 1-2 sentences, not full paragraphs.

### Finding: Bullet points for unordered items (cap at 7); numbered lists for sequential/ranked items; prose for arguments requiring nuance
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** NNGroup research. Keep list items to 1-2 sentences. Lists earn featured snippets and higher social shares.

### Finding: Combined concise writing + scannable layout + objective tone yields +124% usability improvement
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** NNGroup foundational study testing formatting variations.

**Key scannability tools:**
- Bold text on key phrases (1-2 per paragraph max — not entire sentences)
- Table of contents for posts over 1,500 words
- TL;DR / key takeaways at the top
- Callout boxes for critical data, quotes, or warnings
- White space between sections

### Finding: Format selection should match search intent — how-tos, listicles, comparisons, and narratives each serve different purposes
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** BuzzSumo, Orbit Media

| Format | Strength | Data |
|---|---|---|
| How-to | Most popular format (72% of bloggers write them) | Highest organic traffic potential |
| Listicle | Most social shares; high featured snippet eligibility | Best for TOFU awareness |
| Comparison | Highest purchase intent | Best for MOFU/BOFU |
| Narrative/thought leadership | Builds differentiation, brand authority | Rarer, harder, but highest long-term value |

## Findings: Content Types & Topic Selection

### Finding: 75% of B2B buyers say thought leadership led them to research a product they hadn't considered; 60% would pay a premium
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Edelman/LinkedIn 2024 report (n=3,000+ decision-makers)

**Recommended mix:** 60-70% tactical / 30-40% thought leadership by volume.

### Finding: Standard TOFU/MOFU/BOFU ratio is 50/30/20, but BOFU-first strategy shows dramatically higher conversion
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Grow and Convert case study showing 2,400% higher conversion rates from BOFU/MOFU content vs TOFU.

**Content types by funnel stage (B2B SaaS):**

| Stage | Content Types | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| TOFU (Awareness) | Educational, trends, definitions | "What is [concept]", industry reports, beginner guides |
| MOFU (Consideration) | Comparisons, how-tos, case studies | "X vs Y", "How to evaluate [category]", use cases |
| BOFU (Decision) | Product-focused, ROI analysis, migration guides | "X pricing breakdown", "Switching from Y to X", demos |

### Finding: Pillar/cluster strategy — pillar pages (1,500-3,000 words) surrounded by 8-12 interlinked cluster posts
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** HubSpot, multiple SEO sources. Most B2B buyers consume 3-7 pieces of content before talking to sales.

### Finding: Five primary topic ideation sources with prioritization matrix
**Confidence:** INFERRED (practitioner framework)

1. **Customer pain points** — sales call recordings, support tickets, onboarding questions
2. **Keyword research** — search volume + intent mapping
3. **Competitor gaps** — topics competitors rank for that you don't cover
4. **Industry trends** — emerging technologies, regulatory changes, market shifts
5. **Product-led content** — tutorials, use cases, integration guides

**Prioritization scoring:** Business potential × Search demand × (1/Competition) × Expertise fit × Funnel stage alignment

## Gaps / follow-ups

- Edelman/LinkedIn study is B2B broadly, not SaaS-specific
- Grow and Convert case study is a single company; replication data limited
- Pillar/cluster effectiveness data is mostly from HubSpot (both researcher and practitioner — potential bias)
