## Findings

### Finding: Only 15% of decision-makers rate thought leadership as "very good" — but 75% say it prompted them to research products they hadn't considered
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Edelman/LinkedIn (6th annual, n=3,000+). 73% trust thought leadership more than marketing materials.

**Quality drivers that separate the best:**
- Strong research/data (55%)
- Helping audiences understand their own challenges (44%)
- Concrete guidance (43%)
- Unique format or style (66%)

**Shareability drivers:** Shareable stats/quick insights (42%), relevant links (48%). Research/survey reports are the format most shared with colleagues.

**Implications:** The bar for "good" thought leadership is low — most is mediocre. There's enormous upside for teams that invest in quality differentiation.

### Finding: Crestodina's "10x or do Y" — either dramatically exceed expectations OR do something entirely different; 10x can mean simpler, not bigger
**Confidence:** INFERRED (practitioner framework, widely adopted)
**Evidence:** Andy Crestodina / Orbit Media

**Implications:** Differentiation doesn't always mean more — it can mean more focused, more specific, or more opinionated.

### Finding: Pulizzi's "content tilt" — the area of little to no competition where you apply a unique angle to a known topic
**Confidence:** INFERRED (practitioner framework)
**Evidence:** Joe Pulizzi, *Content Inc.* CMI's emerging "purple ocean" strategy blends differentiated ideas with market demand, targeting emerging trends before audiences fully enter.

**Implications:** In the AI era, differentiation is no longer optional — it is the baseline for content that ranks and gets remembered.

### Finding: Proprietary frameworks create category ownership — coining a term forces the market to use your language
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Multiple documented cases:
- HubSpot coined "inbound marketing" (2005-06, now $20B+ company)
- Drift coined "conversational marketing"
- Gong owns "revenue intelligence"
- Gainsight created "customer success" as a category and profession

Anthony Kennada codified the playbook in *Category Creation* (2019). The tradeoff: you must market both the product AND the category, which doubles effort.

**Implications:** The highest-leverage content differentiation strategy is creating language and frameworks that become associated with your brand.

### Finding: 93% of B2B marketers using original research say it effectively drives engagement/leads; fewer than 30% produce their own — a massive competitive gap
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** TopRank/Ascend2 survey. Buyers are 2x more likely to exchange personal info for research-backed content.

**Exemplar case studies:**
- Orbit Media blogger survey: 12 years, 12,971 respondents, 1,600+ backlinks, 150+ hours per edition
- Gong Labs: 95 research pieces built on millions of sales calls, pivotal to lead generation
- HubSpot State of Marketing: 1,500+ respondent annual survey that compounds year over year

**Implications:** Original data is the most underused and highest-ROI differentiation strategy. It creates content that is impossible to replicate and compounds over time.

### Finding: The "so what?" test — the distinction between information (what happened) and insight (why it matters and what to do)
**Confidence:** INFERRED (expert consensus)
**Evidence:** Rand Fishkin's four lenses: one-of-a-kind, relevant, helpful, and uniquely valuable — where "uniquely valuable" means value searchers cannot get from any other result.

**Effective B2B content:**
- Exposes gaps in the audience's current thinking
- Provides forward-looking perspective
- Ensures every claim leads to a strategic conclusion

### Finding: Voice is the hardest differentiator to copy because it reflects organizational culture; 62.7% of marketers say more human-centered content is needed to compete with AI
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** HubSpot 2026 survey (62.7%). Three strong exemplar voices:
- **Basecamp/37signals** — deliberately opinionated, sometimes provocative, no comments section, running since 1999
- **Intercom** — voice emerges from culture; voice/tone distinction drives consistency
- **Stripe** — developer-first, brand-neutral, leadership-modeled writing culture (Increment magazine, Stripe Press)

**Implications:** With AI-generated content flooding every category, distinctive human voice becomes an increasingly critical moat.

## Gaps / follow-ups

- Edelman/LinkedIn study is B2B broadly, not SaaS-specific
- Original research ROI data is self-reported (marketers rating their own strategy)
- Category creation examples are survivorship bias — many companies attempt this and fail
- No quantitative study directly measures "voice distinctiveness" impact on engagement
