## Findings: SEO & On-Page Writing

### Finding: Modern keyword density target is ~0.5-1% with natural cadence; top-ranking pages average ~0.04% density
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Multiple SEO studies. Keyword stuffing is penalized; natural integration is key.

**Where keywords matter most (in priority order):**
1. Title tag (front-loaded)
2. H1
3. First 100 words
4. Meta description
5. H2/H3 subheadings

### Finding: Google confirmed "LSI keywords" do not exist in their algorithm; semantic coverage via NLP/entity understanding is what matters
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Google public statement. BERT and RankBrain understand topic coverage, not keyword synonyms.

### Finding: Pages with search intent mismatch see 70%+ bounce rates; intent-aligned content keeps users engaged 3-4x longer
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** SERP analysis data. If top 10 results for a query are all comparison articles, publishing a different content type will structurally fail.

**Intent mapping for B2B SaaS:**
- Informational → awareness (what is X, how does X work)
- Commercial → consideration (X vs Y, best X for, reviews)
- Transactional → decision (X pricing, X free trial, buy X)

### Finding: Meta descriptions — 150-160 chars desktop, 110-120 mobile; Google rewrites 60-70%
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Search Engine Land, Zyppy. Front-load CTA/primary benefit within first 100 characters for mobile visibility. Accurate, self-describing content matters more than perfect formatting since most get rewritten.

### Finding: 3-10 contextual internal links per post; 10-20 for longer content
**Confidence:** INFERRED (expert consensus)
**Evidence:** Multiple SEO sources. Anchor text should be descriptive and keyword-rich. Exact-match anchors are safe for internal links (unlike external). Every important page should be linked from at least one other page.

### Finding: Featured snippet optimization requires specific formatting patterns
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Multiple snippet studies.

| Snippet Type | Format Required |
|---|---|
| Paragraph | 40-60 word direct answer immediately after question-framed H2/H3 |
| List | Proper HTML list markup (ol/ul) |
| Table | Proper `<table>` markup with clear headers |

Pages must already rank on page 1 to be eligible. Content optimized for snippets also increases eligibility for Google AI Overviews.

## Findings: Readability & Accessibility

### Finding: B2B SaaS should target Flesch-Kincaid Grade 8-10 (Reading Ease 50-60); current B2B tech content averages Grade 15+
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Readability research + case study showing rewriting for readability nearly doubled user recall (65% vs 33%).

**Critical nuance:** Below Grade 8 can undermine credibility with technical buyers. The target is accessible, not dumbed-down.

### Finding: Target 15-20 words per sentence average; paragraphs should be 40-80 words (2-4 sentences), hard max 150 words
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Readability research, web writing best practices.

- Deliberate sentence length variation creates rhythm
- One-sentence paragraphs effective for emphasis when used sparingly
- On mobile, keep paragraphs to 2-3 visual lines

### Finding: B2B SaaS sites receive ~35% mobile traffic; mobile conversion rates are 25-35% lower unless optimized
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** B2B analytics data. Desktop optimal line length: 45-75 characters; mobile: 30-50 characters. A 3-sentence desktop paragraph can become 6-8 lines on phone.

### Finding: 79% of users scan rather than read; users read at most 28% of words on a page
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** NNGroup eye-tracking research (replicated over 20+ years). F-pattern and layer-cake pattern are dominant scanning behaviors.

**Key scannability techniques:**
1. Descriptive subheadings (primary scanner navigation)
2. Bold key phrases (1-2 per paragraph max)
3. Short paragraphs
4. Bulleted/numbered lists
5. Visual hierarchy
6. Front-load key information (inverted pyramid)
