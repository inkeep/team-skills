## Findings: CTAs

### Finding: Inline anchor-text CTAs get 121% higher CTR than sidebar/banner CTAs
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED

### Finding: CTA-content funnel alignment is critical — BOFU CTAs on TOFU content create mismatch
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Neil Patel, SmartBug Media — demo CTAs on educational posts cause jarring disconnects.

### Finding: Gated content generates 82% less organic traffic; hybrid gating (show 30-40% free) yields 164% more traffic with consistent lead quality

## Findings: Visual Elements

### Finding: Custom/natural photos significantly outperform stock photos on CTR, recall, and brand consistency
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** UF/EDIS study; stock photos still outperform no photo at all.

### Finding: Posts with images see 650% higher engagement; 1 image per 75-100 words doubles social shares
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** SEOWriting.ai (650%); BuzzSumo (1:75-100 words = 2x shares)

### Finding: Bloggers using 10+ images per post are ~2x more likely to report strong results
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Orbit Media 2025 Survey

### Finding: Images with faces see 160% higher click-through than images of objects
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Cloudinary

### Finding: Data visualizations and infographics are 30x more likely to be read than text articles
**Confidence:** CONFIRMED
**Evidence:** Multiple B2B marketing sources (Equinet Media, Madison Logic)

### Finding: Recommended image ratio varies by content type
**Confidence:** INFERRED (synthesis of multiple sources)

| Content Type | Image Ratio |
|---|---|
| Long-form informational | 1 image per 200-250 words |
| How-to guides | 1 image per ~180 words |
| Listicles | 1 image per ~130 words |

Overriding principle (Orbit Media): use an image at every scroll depth.

## Findings: Audience Targeting

### Finding: Technical and executive audiences require fundamentally different content approaches
**Confidence:** INFERRED (practitioner consensus)

| Dimension | Technical | Executive |
|---|---|---|
| Tone | Direct, precise, peer-to-peer | Authoritative, outcome-oriented |
| Depth | Implementation detail, specs, code | Strategic implications, ROI, risk |
| Jargon | Expected; less signals ignorance | Minimize; clarity over complexity |
| Trust signals | Technical accuracy, benchmarks, OSS | Logos, analyst quotes, peer results |
| Structure | Dense content OK; values completeness | Scannable; conclusion up front |

### Finding: One post can serve multiple personas only with deliberate architectural choices
**Confidence:** INFERRED
Techniques: TL;DR at top, layered structure (why→what→how), content derivatives by persona, self-selecting navigation.
