# Inkeep Product Intelligence

## One-Line Positioning

**Inkeep**: AI Agents for customer operations — pre-built agents plus custom agent platform with no-code builder and developer SDK.

---

## Core Value Proposition

A unified platform that empowers customer operations teams AND developers to build, deploy, and scale AI agents that take action across business systems. Not just chatbots — agents that perform real work, integrate with existing tools, and continuously improve through feedback loops.

**Key Differentiator**: Both pre-built agents (80% of use cases) AND custom agent platform (remaining 20%) — works for non-technical teams AND developers.

---

## The Four Pillars (Product Capabilities)

| Pillar | What It Does | Persona Connection |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Ask AI** (Deflect) | Pre-built RAG assistant embedded in docs, website, help center | Support Leaders, CX Directors |
| **Copilots** (Enable) | AI-suggested responses inside Zendesk, Salesforce, Intercom | Support Teams, CX Ops |
| **Agentic Workflows** (Automate) | Background automation (ticket closes → update docs) | Support Ops, Head of Docs |
| **Build Your Own** (Create) | No-code visual builder + developer SDK | DevRel, Platform PMs, CTOs |

---

## What NOT to Say

**Avoid these pitches** (they trigger skepticism):

| Don't Say | Why It Fails | Say Instead |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| "AI-powered chatbot" | Chatbot stigma | "AI agents that take action" |
| "Cutting-edge AI" | Buzzword | "Deployed by Anthropic, Datadog, Solana" |
| "All-in-one platform" | Template smell | "Replaces fragmented point solutions" |
| "Save 50% on support costs" | Generic ROI claim | "Fingerprint cut tickets 48% (A/B tested)" |
| "Easy to set up" | Vague | "Live in 48 hours with JS snippet" |
