| Pitching your product first | -57% reply rate | Gong (85M) |
| Adding social proof | +41% replies | Gong (85M) |
| Leading with prospect's problems | +20% replies | Gong (85M) |

## Email Structure Formula

```
Subject: [2-3 words, internal-camo style]

[1 sentence: Personalized observation / relevant trigger]

[1-2 sentences: Problem statement or unconsidered need for their situation]

[1 sentence: Social proof:"We helped [similar company] [specific outcome] in [timeframe]"]

[1 sentence: Interest-based CTA]
```

**Formatting rules:**
- 1 sentence per paragraph (2 max)
- Line break between every paragraph
- Plain text only (no images, GIFs, links in first touch)
- 8-12 words per sentence average
- No industry jargon (TCO, MTTR, "all-in-one platform")

---

## Subject Lines

**What works:**
- 1-4 words (highest open rates)
- Look like internal emails ("Reply Rates", "Q2 Forecasts", "Hiring Ops")
- Neutral, lowercase or title case (both beat sentence case)

**What fails:**
- First name in subject (-12% replies)
- Numbers/metrics in subject (-46% less likely to open in cold)
- Punctuation in subject (-36% less likely to open)
- Emojis (-6% open rates)
- re:/fwd: tricks (spam signal)

---

## CTAs That Work

| CTA Type | Reply Rate | Positive Reply % |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| Interest-based | 12% | 68% |
| Time-request | 7% | 41% |
| "Thoughts?" | Higher replies | -20% meetings |

**Examples that work:**
- "Is this on your radar for Q2?"
- "Can I send you the benchmark data on [metric]?"
- "Worth a 5-minute look at how [similar company] solved this?"
- "Open to seeing how this compares to your current setup?"

**Examples that fail:**
- "Do you have 15 minutes Thursday?"
- "What are your thoughts?"
- "Let me know if you're interested"
- "Would love to set up a quick call"

---

## Personalization Spectrum

| ACV | Personalization Level | Time/Prospect |
|-----|----------------------|---------------|
| $100K+ (Enterprise) | Deep per-prospect research | 10-15 min |
| $20-50K (Mid-market) | Segment + light individual | 2-3 min |
| <$20K (SMB/Velocity) | Tight segmentation + strong template | 0-1 min |

**What "relevance" means vs "personalization":**
- **Personalization:** "I saw you went to [University]":about their identity
- **Relevance:** "Noticed [Company] hired 3 RevOps leads:usually a sign territory complexity is increasing":about their current business situation

---

## Timing & Sending

**Best days:** Tuesday-Thursday
**Best time:** 6-11 AM recipient's timezone
**Avoid:** Monday (inbox overload), Friday PM, Saturday

**Volume limits:**
- Max 100 cold emails/day per sending address
- Consistent daily volume (erratic patterns trigger spam)

---

## Follow-Up Strategy

| Email | Type | Content | Timing |
|-------|------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Value Email | Personalized problem + CTA | Day 1 |
| 2 | Context Bump | Supporting data, same thread | Day 3 |
| 3 | Value Email | New angle, new thread | Day 7 |
| 4 | Context Bump | Final supporting context | Day 10 |
| 5 | New Angle | Completely different value prop | Day 14 |
| 6 | Breakup | Resource share, not guilt | Day 21 |

**Key stats:**
- Email 2 = +49% reply lift (highest leverage)
- 4+ sentence follow-ups = 15x more meetings vs short bumps
- "I never heard back" = -14% meetings
- Breakup emails = 33-76% response rate

## Phrases That Kill Replies

| Phrase | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| "Quick chat" / "Quick call" | Trivializes their time |
| "Just following up" | No new value |
| "I hope this finds you well" | Filler, signals template |
| "I was hoping to..." | Passive, lacks confidence |
| "I know you're busy, but..." | Manipulative pre-framing |
| "Pick your brain" | Vague meeting signal |
| "Not sure if you saw my previous email" | Nagging |
| "Never heard back" | -14% meetings |
| "We're a leading provider of..." | Template-smell |
| ROI claims without context | -15% success rate |

---

## The "Template Smell" Checklist

If your email has any of these, recipients know it's mass-sent:
- [ ] Starts with "I/My/We/Our"
- [ ] Contains buzzwords ("innovative", "cutting-edge", "all-in-one")
- [ ] Includes rounded numbers ("save 40%") instead of specific ("save 37%")
- [ ] Has generic social proof ("leading companies")
- [ ] Asks for a meeting before establishing value
- [ ] Reads above 8th grade reading level

## Psychological Principles

| Principle | Application |

| **Social proof** | Peer companies, specific metrics (+41% replies) |
| **Cognitive fluency** | Short words, short sentences, 3rd-5th grade level |
| **Curiosity gap** | Hint at insight without spoiling it |

## Multi-Channel Impact

| Channel Mix | vs Email-Only |
|-------------|---------------|
| Email + LinkedIn | 3x conversion |
| Email + voicemail | 2.15x email reply rate |
| Full multi-channel | up to 4.7x engagement |
