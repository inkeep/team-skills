# Customer Social Proof

Use 1-2 customer names that match the prospect by industry and size. Keep it to one short line.

## Insertion Patterns

- "Teams like **{Customer A}** and **{Customer B}** use Inkeep to..."
- "We work with teams like **{Customer}** on..."
- "If helpful, I can share what worked for **{Customer}**."
