## How master decks work

Master decks are team-maintained Google Slides templates. They establish the canonical structure, styling, and content flow for each presentation type.

**Rules:**
- **Always clone, never edit.** Create a copy of the master deck, then customize the copy.
- **One master per type.** If multiple masters exist for the same type, use the one marked as primary.
- **Keep masters current.** When the team updates a master deck, the URL stays the same — new clones pick up the latest version.

## Templates
