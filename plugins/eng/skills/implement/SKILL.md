# Implement

Convert a SPEC.md into implementation-ready artifacts and execute the iteration loop. This skill operates in three phases:

1. **Convert** — Transform SPEC.md into a structured spec.json
2. **Prepare** — Validate the spec.json, craft the implementation prompt, save it to a file
3. **Execute** — Run `scripts/implement.sh` to iterate through user stories via subprocess

Each phase can be entered independently. If you already have a spec.json, start at Phase 2. If artifacts are ready and you need execution, start at Phase 3. If you only need conversion, stop after Phase 1.

When composed by `/ship`, Ship invokes `/implement` for the full lifecycle and reviews the output afterward. When standalone, `/implement` runs end-to-end and reports results directly.

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPEC.md or spec.json path | Yes | — | Source artifact. When SPEC.md: used for Phase 1 conversion AND forwarded as iteration reference in Phase 2 (see Spec path forwarding). When spec.json: start at Phase 2 directly. |
| `--test-cmd` | No | `pnpm test --run` | Test runner command for quality gates |
| `--typecheck-cmd` | No | `pnpm typecheck` | Type checker command for quality gates |
| `--lint-cmd` | No | `pnpm lint` | Linter command for quality gates |
| `--no-browser` | No | Browser assumed available | Omit "Verify in browser" criteria from UI stories; substitute with Bash-verifiable criteria |
| `--docker [compose-file]` | No | — | Use Docker for Phase 3 execution. Optionally accepts a path to the compose file (e.g., `--docker .ai-dev/docker-compose.yml`). When passed without a path, discovers the compose file automatically. When omitted entirely, execution runs on the host. |

When composed by `/ship`, these overrides are passed based on Phase 0 context detection. When running standalone, defaults apply.

### Spec path forwarding

When a SPEC.md is provided (directly or by the invoker), the path persists beyond Phase 1 conversion. In Phase 2, the skill embeds a file-path reference in the implementation prompt so that iteration agents read the full SPEC.md as the first action of every iteration. The spec content is NOT embedded in the prompt — the prompt contains only the file path.

This is mandatory when a spec path is available. The spec contains critical implementation context that spec.json's `implementationContext` cannot fully capture:
- **Non-goals** (what NOT to build) — completely absent from spec.json
- **Current state code traces** (file paths, line numbers, existing patterns) — compressed to prose in implementationContext
- **Decision rationale** — reduced to conclusions only
- **Risks and failure modes** — only partially captured in acceptance criteria

When only spec.json is provided (no SPEC.md available), `implementationContext` serves as the sole implementation context source. See Phase 1's implementationContext guidance for how to calibrate depth.

---

## Detect starting point

| Condition | Begin at |
|---|---|
| SPEC.md exists, no spec.json | Phase 1 (Convert) |
| spec.json exists, needs validation/prompt | Phase 2 (Prepare) |
| spec.json + `tmp/ship/implement-prompt.md` exist, ready to execute | Phase 3 (Execute) |
| Called with only a conversion request | Phase 1, then stop |

---

## Phase 1: Convert (SPEC.md to spec.json)

Take a SPEC.md and convert it to `tmp/ship/spec.json`. Create `tmp/ship/` if it doesn't exist (`mkdir -p tmp/ship`).

### Output format

```json
{
  "project": "[Project Name]",
  "branchName": "implement/[feature-name-kebab-case]",
  "description": "[Feature description from SPEC.md title/intro]",
  "implementationContext": "[Concise prose summary of architecture, constraints, key decisions, and current state from the SPEC.md — everything the implementer needs to know that doesn't fit in individual stories]",
  "userStories": [
    {
      "id": "US-001",
      "title": "[Story title]",
      "description": "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Criterion 1",

      ],
      "priority": 1,
      "passes": false,
      "notes": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

### Story size: the number one rule

**Each story must be completable in ONE iteration (one context window).**

Each iteration receives the same prompt with no memory of previous work — only files and git history persist. If a story is too big, the LLM runs out of context before finishing and produces broken code.

**Right-sized stories:**
- Add a database column and migration
- Add a UI component to an existing page
- Update a server action with new logic
- Add a filter dropdown to a list

**Too big (split these):**
- "Build the entire dashboard" — Split into: schema, queries, UI components, filters
- "Add authentication" — Split into: schema, middleware, login UI, session handling
- "Refactor the API" — Split into one story per endpoint or pattern

**Rule of thumb:** If you cannot describe the change in 2-3 sentences, it is too big.

### Story ordering: dependencies first

Stories execute in priority order. Earlier stories must not depend on later ones.

**Correct order:**
1. Schema/database changes (migrations)
2. Server actions / backend logic
3. UI components that use the backend
4. Dashboard/summary views that aggregate data

**Wrong order:**
1. UI component (depends on schema that does not exist yet)
2. Schema change

### Acceptance criteria: must be verifiable

Each criterion must be something the iteration agent can CHECK, not something vague.

**Good criteria (verifiable):**
- "Add `status` column to tasks table with default 'pending'"
- "Filter dropdown has options: All, Active, Completed"
- "Clicking delete shows confirmation dialog"
- "Typecheck passes"
- "Tests pass"

**Bad criteria (vague):**
- "Works correctly"
- "User can do X easily"
- "Good UX"
- "Handles edge cases"

**Implementation-coupled criteria (fragile):**
- "handleStatusChange calls db.update with the correct enum"
- "Component renders by calling useTaskList hook"
- "API handler invokes validateInput before processing"

**Behavioral criteria (resilient):**
- "Task with changed status is retrievable with the new status"
- "Task list displays only tasks matching the selected filter"
- "Invalid status value returns 400 with descriptive error message"

Implementation-coupled criteria produce tests that break on refactor even when behavior is unchanged. Behavioral criteria produce tests that survive internal restructuring. See /tdd.

**Always include as final criterion:**
```
"Typecheck passes"
```

For stories with testable logic, also include:
```
"Tests pass"
```

For stories that change UI — **if browser automation is available** (no `--no-browser` flag):
```
"Verify in browser using dev-browser skill"
```

Frontend stories are NOT complete until visually verified. The iteration agent will use the dev-browser skill to navigate to the page, interact with the UI, and confirm changes work.

**If browser is NOT available** (`--no-browser`): Omit the browser criterion. Instead, add Bash-verifiable criteria that cover the UI behavior through API responses or rendered output (e.g., "API response includes the updated status badge markup", "Server-rendered HTML contains filter dropdown with options: All, Active, Completed").

### Conversion rules

1. **Each user story becomes one JSON entry**
2. **IDs**: Sequential (US-001, US-002, etc.)
3. **Priority**: Based on dependency order, then document order
4. **All stories**: `passes: false` and empty `notes`
5. **branchName**: Derive from feature name, kebab-case, prefixed with `implement/`
6. **Always add**: "Typecheck passes" to every story's acceptance criteria

### Extracting implementation context from the SPEC.md

The `implementationContext` field captures spec-level knowledge that applies across all stories — things the implementer needs every iteration but that don't belong in any single story's acceptance criteria.

Extract from these SPEC.md sections:

| SPEC.md section | What to extract | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| §9 Proposed solution — System design | Architecture overview, data model, API shape, auth/permissions model | Without this, the implementer guesses the architecture or contradicts the spec's design |
| §6 Non-functional requirements | Performance targets, security constraints, reliability requirements, operability needs | These constrain *how* every story is implemented, not *what* |
| §10 Decision log | Settled decisions (especially 1-way doors) with brief rationale | Prevents the implementer from revisiting or contradicting decisions made during the spec process |
| §8 Current state | How the system works today, key integration points, known gaps | The implementer needs to know what exists to integrate with it correctly |

**What to write:** A concise prose summary. Not a copy-paste of the spec sections — a distillation of what the implementer needs to hold in mind while working on every story.

**Calibrate depth based on spec availability:**

| Spec available during implementation? | implementationContext role | Recommended depth |
|---|---|---|
| **Yes** — spec path forwarded to Phase 2 (default when composed by `/ship` or when user provides both) | Quick orientation summary. The full SPEC.md provides deep context — iteration agents read it as step 1. | 3-5 sentences — architecture overview and key constraints only |
| **No** — spec.json is the sole artifact (user invokes `/implement` with spec.json only, or spec is unavailable) | Primary and sole implementation context source. Must stand on its own. | 5-10 sentences — include architecture, non-goals, current state integration points, key decisions with rationale, and critical constraints |

When in doubt about whether the spec will be available, write the longer form — it's never wrong to include more context, but the shorter form risks leaving the iteration agent under-informed.

**Good example:**
> "The feature adds a `status` column to the tasks table with an enum type. The API uses the existing RESTful pattern in `/api/tasks/`. Auth is handled by the existing tenant-scoped middleware — do not add new auth logic. The current task list fetches via `getTasksByProject()` in the data-access layer; the new filter must use the same query pattern. Decision D3: we chose server-side filtering over client-side because the dataset can exceed 10k rows."

**Bad example (too vague):**
> "Implement the task status feature following good practices."

### Splitting large specs

If a SPEC.md has large features, split them:

**Original:**
> "Add user notification system"

**Split into:**
1. US-001: Add notifications table to database
2. US-002: Create notification service for sending notifications
3. US-003: Add notification bell icon to header
4. US-004: Create notification dropdown panel
5. US-005: Add mark-as-read functionality
6. US-006: Add notification preferences page

Each is one focused change that can be completed and verified independently.

### Converting failure paths into acceptance criteria

SPEC.md §5 (User journeys) includes failure/recovery paths and debug experience per persona. These are often the difference between a feature that works in demos and one that works in production.

Do not discard failure paths during conversion. For each failure scenario in the spec:

1. **Identify which story it belongs to** — match the failure to the story that implements the relevant functionality.
2. **Convert it to a verifiable acceptance criterion** on that story.

**Example:**

SPEC.md failure path:
> Failure: User sets an invalid status value via API → System returns 400 with error message "Invalid status. Allowed values: pending, in_progress, done"

Becomes an acceptance criterion on the relevant story:
```
"API returns 400 with descriptive error when status value is not in [pending, in_progress, done]"
```

If a failure scenario spans multiple stories (e.g., "network error during save should show retry button"), attach the criterion to the story where the user-facing behavior lives (the UI story, not the backend story).

### Applying non-functional requirements as cross-cutting criteria

SPEC.md §6 includes non-functional requirements: performance, reliability, security/privacy, operability, cost. These constrain *how* stories are implemented.

For each non-functional requirement in the spec:

1. **Determine if it's universally applicable** (e.g., "all endpoints must validate tenant isolation") or **story-specific** (e.g., "list query must return in <200ms for 10k rows").
2. **Universal constraints**: add as a criterion to every story they apply to.
3. **Story-specific constraints**: add as a criterion to the relevant story only.

**Examples:**

| Non-functional requirement | Becomes criterion on |
|---|---|
| "All API endpoints must validate tenant isolation" | Every story that adds/modifies an API endpoint |
| "List query must paginate and return in <200ms" | The story that implements the list/filter |
| "Status changes must be audit-logged" | The story that implements the status toggle |

Do not create separate "non-functional" stories. These constraints should be woven into the stories that implement the relevant functionality.

### Example

**Input SPEC.md (abbreviated):**
```markdown
# Task Status Feature

Add ability to mark tasks with different statuses.

## Requirements
- Toggle between pending/in-progress/done on task list
- Filter list by status
- Show status badge on each task
- Persist status in database

## Non-functional requirements
- Status changes must be tenant-scoped

## User journeys — Failure paths
- Invalid status value via API → return 400 with descriptive error

## Current state
- Tasks stored in tasks table, accessed via getTasksByProject()
- API uses RESTful patterns under /api/tasks/
- UI uses TaskCard component in components/tasks/
```

### Archiving previous runs

**Before writing a new spec.json, check if there is an existing one from a different feature:**

1. Read the current `tmp/ship/spec.json` if it exists
2. Check if `branchName` differs from the new feature's branch name
3. If different AND `tmp/ship/progress.txt` has content beyond the header:
   - Create archive folder: `tmp/ship/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name/`
   - Copy current `tmp/ship/spec.json` and `tmp/ship/progress.txt` to archive
   - Reset `tmp/ship/progress.txt` with fresh header

### Phase 1 checklist

Before writing spec.json, verify:

- [ ] **Previous run archived** (if `tmp/ship/spec.json` exists with different branchName, archive it first)
- [ ] Each story is completable in one iteration (small enough)
- [ ] Stories are ordered by dependency (schema to backend to UI)
- [ ] Every story has "Typecheck passes" as criterion
- [ ] UI stories have "Verify in browser using dev-browser skill" as criterion (if browser available) or Bash-verifiable substitutes (if `--no-browser`)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are verifiable and not vague; functional criteria describe observable behavior, not internal mechanisms (see /tdd)
- [ ] No story depends on a later story
- [ ] **`implementationContext` extracted** from SPEC.md §8, §9, §10, §6 — concise prose, not a copy-paste
- [ ] **Failure/recovery paths** from SPEC.md §5 converted into acceptance criteria on relevant stories
- [ ] **Non-functional requirements** from SPEC.md §6 applied as cross-cutting criteria where applicable

---

## Phase 2: Prepare

Validate the spec.json, craft the implementation prompt, and save it to a file for execution.

### Validate spec.json against SPEC.md

Compare each user story to its corresponding requirement in the SPEC.md:

- [ ] Stories are correctly scoped (each completable in one iteration)
- [ ] Stories are properly ordered (dependencies first)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are specific and verifiable
- [ ] No requirements from the SPEC.md are missing from spec.json
- [ ] No stories exceed what the SPEC.md calls for

Fix discrepancies before starting execution — errors here compound through every iteration.

### Validate spec.json schema

If `bun` is available, run the schema validator:

```bash
bun <path-to-skill>/scripts/validate-spec.ts tmp/ship/spec.json
```

This checks structural integrity: required fields, ID format (US-NNN), sequential priorities, duplicate detection, and "Typecheck passes" criterion presence. Zero external dependencies — runs anywhere bun is installed.

If `bun` is not available, manually verify the spec.json structure matches the schema in Phase 1.

### Place spec.json

Put spec.json at `tmp/ship/spec.json`. Create `tmp/ship/` if it doesn't exist (`mkdir -p tmp/ship`).

### Verify branch safety

If on `main` or `master`, warn before proceeding — the implement skill should normally run on a feature branch. If no branching model exists (e.g., container environment with no PR workflow), proceed with caution and ensure commits are isolated.

### Craft the implementation prompt

**Load:** `templates/implement-prompt.template.md`

The template contains two complete prompt variants with `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` syntax. Choose ONE variant and fill all placeholders.

**Choose variant:**
- **Variant A** — when a SPEC.md path is available (directly provided or from Phase 1)
- **Variant B** — when only spec.json is available (no SPEC.md)

**Conditionality lives HERE (in Phase 2 construction), NOT in the iteration prompt.** The iteration agent sees a single, unconditional workflow — never both variants, never conditional "if spec is available" logic.

**Fill `{{CODEBASE_CONTEXT}}`:** Include the specific patterns, shared vocabulary, and abstractions in the area being modified — more actionable than generic CLAUDE.md guidance. Examples: "The API follows RESTful patterns under /api/tasks/", "Auth uses tenant-scoped middleware in auth.ts", "Data access uses the repository pattern in data-access/". Also include repo conventions from CLAUDE.md (testing patterns, file locations, formatting) that the iteration agent needs.

**Fill quality gate commands:** Use the commands from Inputs (defaults: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test --run`) — override with `--typecheck-cmd`, `--lint-cmd`, `--test-cmd` if provided.

**Fill `{{SPEC_PATH}}`** (Variant A only): Use a path relative to the working directory (e.g., `.claude/specs/my-feature/SPEC.md`). Relative paths work across execution contexts (host, Docker, worktree). Do NOT use absolute paths — they break when the prompt is executed in a different environment. Do NOT embed spec content in the prompt — the iteration agent reads it via the Read tool each iteration.

### Save the prompt

Save the crafted implementation prompt to `tmp/ship/implement-prompt.md`. This file is consumed by Phase 3 (`scripts/implement.sh`) for automated execution, or by the user for manual iteration (`claude -p`).

### Copy implement.sh to execution location

Copy the skill's canonical `scripts/implement.sh` to `tmp/ship/implement.sh` in the working directory and make it executable:

```bash
cp <path-to-skill>/scripts/implement.sh tmp/ship/implement.sh
chmod +x tmp/ship/implement.sh
```

This places the iteration loop script alongside the implementation prompt (`tmp/ship/implement-prompt.md`) as a paired execution artifact. The copy enables:
- **Manual execution** — users can run `tmp/ship/implement.sh --force` directly without knowing the skill's install path
- **Docker execution** — containers access `tmp/ship/implement.sh` via bind mount (see `references/execution.md`)

Phase 3 on host uses the skill's own `scripts/implement.sh` directly (validate-spec.ts is available next to it). The `tmp/ship/implement.sh` copy is for Docker, manual, and external execution contexts.

### Phase 2 checklist

- [ ] spec.json validated against SPEC.md (if available)
- [ ] spec.json schema validated (via `scripts/validate-spec.ts` if bun available)
- [ ] Stories correctly scoped, ordered, and with verifiable criteria
- [ ] Implementation prompt crafted from template with correct variant (A or B)
- [ ] All `{{PLACEHOLDERS}}` filled (spec path, quality gates, codebase context)
- [ ] Completion signal present in saved prompt (included in template — verify not accidentally removed)
- [ ] Prompt saved to `tmp/ship/implement-prompt.md`
- [ ] `implement.sh` copied to `tmp/ship/implement.sh` and made executable

---

## Phase 3: Execute

Run the iteration loop via `scripts/implement.sh`. Each iteration spawns a fresh Claude Code subprocess — full capabilities, zero shared context between iterations.

**Load:** `references/execution.md`

### Step 1: Ensure dependencies and build environment

Before starting iterations, ensure the working directory has a functioning development environment. Iteration agents need deps installed and the build working to run quality gates.

1. **Detect the package manager** from `package.json` `packageManager` field (e.g., `pnpm@10.10.0`). If a specific version is pinned, use `npx <pm>@<version> install` to avoid lockfile mismatches.
2. **Install dependencies** if `node_modules/` is missing or stale:
   ```bash
   # Example for pnpm-pinned repos:
   npx pnpm@<version> install
   ```
3. **Run conductor setup** if `conductor.json` exists in the repo root.
4. **Verify the build is clean:**
   ```bash
   <typecheck-cmd>  # e.g., pnpm typecheck
   ```
   If typecheck fails, this is a pre-existing issue — log it but do not block. The iteration loop may fix it.

This step is idempotent — if deps are already installed and the build is clean, it completes instantly. Skip entirely if running inside Docker (`--docker`), where the container image provides the environment.

### Step 2: Probe for Claude CLI

Check if automated execution is possible:

```bash
env -u CLAUDECODE -u CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT claude --version
```

If this fails, automated execution is not available — skip to the fallback below.

### Step 3: Choose execution context (host vs Docker)

**If `--docker` was NOT passed:** Execute on the host (default). Proceed to Step 4.

**If `--docker` was passed:** Use Docker for execution.

1. **Resolve the compose file.** If a path was provided (e.g., `--docker .ai-dev/docker-compose.yml`), use it. Otherwise, discover it: search the repo for `**/docker-compose.yml` or `**/compose.yml` files whose content defines a `sandbox` service. Use the first match. If none found, error: "No compose file with a sandbox service found in this repo."

2. **Ensure the container is running:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f <compose-file> ps --status running sandbox
   ```
   If not running, start it: `docker compose -f <compose-file> up -d`.

3. Proceed — Step 6 uses the Docker invocation variant.

### Step 4: Pre-execution quality gate baseline

Before starting the iteration loop, run the quality gates to establish a baseline:

```bash
<typecheck-cmd>  # e.g., pnpm typecheck
<lint-cmd>       # e.g., pnpm lint
<test-cmd>       # e.g., pnpm test --run
```

If any gate fails, warn the operator: "Quality gates are failing before implementation starts. Pre-existing failures will cost iterations to diagnose. Consider fixing them first."

Log the baseline to `tmp/ship/progress.txt` regardless of result:

```
## Pre-execution baseline - [timestamp]
- Typecheck: PASS/FAIL
- Lint: PASS/FAIL
- Test: PASS/FAIL
```

Do not block execution — the operator may be running `/implement` specifically to fix failures. But the baseline log helps iteration agents distinguish pre-existing failures from regressions they introduced.

### Step 5: Determine parameters

Count the incomplete stories in spec.json and select parameters:

| Feature complexity | --max-iterations | --max-turns |
|---|---|---|
| Small (1-3 stories) | 10-15 | 50 |
| Medium (4-8 stories) | 20-30 | 75 |
| Large (9+ stories) | 30-50 | 100 |

### Step 6: Invoke implement.sh

Run in background to avoid the Bash tool's 600-second timeout.

**Host execution (default):**

```
Bash(command: "<path-to-skill>/scripts/implement.sh --max-iterations <N> --max-turns <M> --force",
     run_in_background: true,
     description: "Implement execution run 1")
```

**Docker execution (when `--docker` was passed — compose file resolved in Step 3):**

```
Bash(command: "docker compose -f <compose-file> exec sandbox tmp/ship/implement.sh --max-iterations <N> --max-turns <M> --force",
     run_in_background: true,
     description: "Implement Docker execution run 1")
```

Always pass `--force` — background execution has no TTY for interactive prompts.

Poll for completion using `TaskOutput(block: false)` at intervals. While waiting, do lightweight work (re-read spec, review task list) but do NOT make code changes that could conflict.

### Step 7: Assess results

When implement.sh completes, read `tmp/ship/spec.json` and `tmp/ship/progress.txt`:

- **All stories `passes: true`** → execution succeeded. Proceed to Phase 3 checklist.
- **Some stories incomplete** → check `tmp/ship/progress.txt` for blockers. Apply stuck story handling (see `references/execution.md`), then re-invoke implement.sh for another run.
- **implement.sh exited with error** → read output for details. If transient (network, rate limit), retry once. If persistent, fall back to manual instructions.

### Step 8: Stuck story handling (between runs)

If the same story fails across 2 consecutive implement.sh runs with the same blocker:

1. **Story too large** → split into smaller stories in spec.json
2. **Criteria ambiguous** → rewrite criteria to be more specific
3. **External dependency blocking** → skip the story, set `notes` explaining the blocker
4. **Wrong implementation approach** → add guidance to `tmp/ship/progress.txt` suggesting an alternative

After 3 consecutive failed runs on the same story, stop and consult the user.

Re-invoke implement.sh after applying remediation. Maximum 3 total implement.sh runs before escalating to the user.

### Fallback: Claude CLI not available

If the Claude CLI probe in Step 1 failed, automated execution is not possible. `/implement` still provides full value through Phases 1-2 — the artifacts are ready.

Tell the user:

1. The implementation artifacts have been saved to `tmp/ship/implement-prompt.md` and `tmp/ship/implement.sh`
2. For manual execution using the iteration loop:
   ```bash
   tmp/ship/implement.sh --max-iterations <N> --max-turns <M> --force
   ```

### Phase 3 checklist

- [ ] All stories in `tmp/ship/spec.json` have `passes: true` (or stuck stories documented with `notes`)
- [ ] `tmp/ship/progress.txt` reviewed — no unresolved blockers
- [ ] Quality gates pass: typecheck, lint, test

**After Phase 3:**
- If composed by `/ship`: Ship continues with post-implementation review and testing.
- If standalone: read every file created or modified. The implementation output is your starting point, not your endpoint. Run quality gates manually.
